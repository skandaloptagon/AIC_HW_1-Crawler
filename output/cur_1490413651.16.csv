Amazing cigar from the early nineties a classicMM with a twist - strong, full body and obnoxious in a good way - one does not get/taste cigars like that these days, but if one never tried that one - it is a shame. Discontinued in 1999.

"July 30, 2009",Diplomaticos  Diplomaticos No. 7,"  The wrapper of this more than 20 yo cigar is colorado-colored, very fine, a little bit shiny. The rolling seems to be perfect (and later on I can find a perfect draw).

The smell of decent oak wood and pure tobacco is very pleasant.

So, let's fire up that lil' baby. The first draws reveal a very intensive and strong taste. Wow... I hadn't expected it by a cigar of that age which is also said to be on the light side. Flavors of roasted nuts and coffee, wood, tobacco and leather are present from the very beginning. It starts with a beat of the drum! The combination is very well balanced and the flavors get more intensive and fade away in a very interesting interaction.

The second third is mainly characterized by woody and herbal components... sometimes a aroma of mushrooms joins.....

The last third shows what it really is: tobacco, pure tobacco. And that is the taste... old, pure tobacco... to be honest: that's what I would expect, 'cause in the end it is just a cigar.

The smoke was very thick, creamy... almost fat! The draw was perfect over the whole smoking time of 80 minutes, the burn-off was ruler-straight.

I'm happy that I opened the box. The cigar was a dream, is very tasty and good to smoke. I don't know how it will be in future if would rest still more years. I don't care about it and just enjoy the moment!",4.5,eldondo,2:

"April 11, 2013",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 1,I picked up the last 8 of these remaining in a box at the Hotel Sevilla two years ago.

"June 7, 2010",Cuaba  Tradicionales,"First review...
I smoked one of these while strolling around the grounds of a beautiful hotel converted from an old castle in north Wales. Sadly the cigar did not match the experience. As many people have already said, it was brutally plugged and I ended up abandoning it long before I usually would. The way the format allows the flavour to develop as the gauge increases is certainly interesting, however this cigar failed to take full advantage of this with pleasant but plain tobacco and wood flavours.
It is worth mentioning that this cigar came from a rather meagre selection of habanos in a small humidor in the hotel bar, so may not be idicative of all of these. However, I have tried other Cuabas from the shop I work in (where i know they are kept well) and have experienced similar problems.",2.0,dreadary,29:
"November 22, 2016",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  The H.upmann No. 2 is a very young cigar. With a box date of early 14 this cigar has great aging potential. With notes of toast, old coffee grounds, and wood this really is a stale cigar. No floral notes or sweetness but with years of age I can very easily see this cigar develop into a lovely and pleasant cigar. But right now, it is far too young and offeres very stale flavors.",3.5,hunterd16,106:
"October 8, 2016",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  These are great cigars depending on the years.  The 2012's are unbelievable, but the later ones sometimes have bad burns.  They are about 10-20 percent cheaper than Monte 2's and this is the reason.  They have typical strong, musty, nutty, and aromatic flavors and look great as they age.  Their aging potential is wonderful, but the uneven burns sometimes sour my overall view when taking the time to age.  It is better to wait on the Monte's IMHO, and smoke the Upmanns because they are really good when they are young.",4.5,owensinco,105:
"September 10, 2015",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  Medium flavored, starts with spice and white pepper. Subtle Upmann sweet woodiness is there but still possesses some predominate tannins from youth.Only slight evolution through the first two thirds, the final third was more complex with that Cuban earthiness and milk coffee coming through. Solid cigars, well constructed and burn well. I have sampled from all three boxes I have of the same factory/date code (UPE AGO13) and all have been amazingly consistent. Still, IMO these cigars will not come into their own without at least another three years age on them.",4.0,oli62,104:
"June 29, 2015",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  Bought duty free a long time ago and religiously stored. Great wrapper, feel, and pre light draw. Woody and honeyed first third and pretty much till the 1st half. From there hay, leather,  and  nuts with occasional cocoa until the end. Impeccable burn and nice white ash that refused to drop. No bitter or harsh flavors ever...a truly excellent cigar with fantastic taste.",4.5,bucketlist,103:
"May 30, 2015",H.

I'm a very experienced cigar smoker and despite the youth of 14 production,  these are far and away better quality cigars than any other year since probably 1994! I'm sorry for others who wasted their money on previous years because it truly was a waste of money compared to the LUB production in 2014.

"September 1, 2010",Vegueros  Seoane,"  After finishing a cardboard pack of 5 sticks over a period of a few months, I feel that I have come to understand this stick. Despite being touted as a fuller bodied marque, I found this particular stick quite mild in flavour and light in body. Quite a contrast to the No.1 and No. 2. On the tongue, mainly freshly brewed black coffee with aromatic wood and some dryish, cedary notes. But on the nose, very floral, sweet and fragrant, freshly cut grass and incense. Some citrusy nuances creep in towards the final third. One of those sticks that you must enjoy with your mouth and your nose. Ever present spice on the tongue. Surprisingly thick and voluminous smoke for such a small, delicate stick. Deceptively long. Very well made and burns even. More of an aperitif cigar and a good one at that. Now increasingly rare in Australia but will certainly age another pack of 5, maybe 2 packs, for the short term to see what happens.",4.0,sengjc,12:

"August 20, 2009",Vegueros  Seoane,"  After reading the reviews on this site; I thought it worth a try. I had expected a box of 25, not 5 packs of 5. They were smaller than I had expected, slightly oily and soft to touch with and a gentle aromatic tobacco smell. Not quiite my normal smoke- at least they appeared well made - hand made. On lighting, the taste was subtle with surprisingly plenty smoke for the size - a pleasant sweet smell. A most enjoyable easy any time of the day smoke - Had several - each one a simple unpretentious pleasure - any time of the day.

Construction held together fine, but I had to relight several times, which is odd considering how loose the draw was.  After so many relights, I felt like the flavour was a bit ruined.  Every 3/4 of an inch required a touch up or a relight.
The initial flavour was a nice creamy, sweet coffee.  I had just smoked a Montecristo Open Eagle last week, so I was bit tired of coffee flavours, but it was slightly different, so rather pleasant.  After that, the lighting issues started.  I feel like I burned through this at an odd pace.  The second third was a bit smokey tasting due to how charred the tobacco was at this point.  Imagine coffee and burning wood.  The final third was weak in flavour.
I was really disappointed by this cigar.  Maybe it was a bit too moist, maybe the construction was a bit poorer than I thought, I don't know.  I'm not gonna bother trying again with it.  I'm not gonna recommend this to others.  Get the PSP2 or Montecristo #2 if you want a good torpedo/piramide.",2.5,wraffles,102:

Light to medium body. Excellent construction, burns dead even. Flavours of milk coffee, caramelly notes, quite floral but low intensity. Clean tobacco flavour and has a cedary aftertaste which is pleasing. Undemanding but not remarkable. Not a bad smoke for the daytime. One can imagine a group of high powered executives breaking out a box of these to celebrate after clinching a multi-million dollar deal, that is, if you can still smoke in offices.

I see 'floral' mentioned in some of the other reviews, but that is not a word I would use to describe the taste. Nor did I pick up any cocao or coffee.

"November 23, 2015",Romeo y Julieta  Wide Churchills,"This cigar has consistently been a 7-8 for me and were I interested in spending more of my disposable income this would be my regular smoke. When it first came out it was wonderful. I would have given it an 8 and left it at that. Over the past year or so the quality of the build has gone down a bit and I get a less even burn. I smoke hot (fast) and I find that I am regularly burning my fingers on these since I smoke them right to the end and they don't build up a strong bitterness like some other brands.

A lot of folks have commented on the size and that has to be a part of the allure for these cigars for me. I tend to prefer a larger ring on my cigars and this one seems to hit the mark.

These are your staple R&amp;J with their typical flavour profile. If you like R&amp;J, you will like these. If you prefer something spicier, these will never rate above a 7. 

I read some of the other reviews and they mention letting them age. If you have the patience you should give that a try and see how you feel about it.

One thing I can say - open the box before you buy. I always look for a nice, oily shine. Something a little dark. Those ones seem to be the best from my experience with these (I've probably only smoked about 50-60 of these cigars though so some people will likely have a broader experience) I have a box on hand that I will try and age for a year and see what that does - of course, I will have to try one now, for science and all that.",4.0,robdoyle,24:

This is definitely one of the coolest looking cigars I've seen. Perfect color, short and fat. Very cool double bands. 

Great pre-light aroma. The first few puffs were reminiscent of my first dime store cigars -- very pure tobacco taste. Throughout the smoke everything was lightly aromatic, very smooth and refined. Unfortunately the draw was quite tight, and the underwhelming amount of smoke led to an ashy flavor. 

I don't know if this cigar would benefit from more age. I had high hopes for this one, but it didn't hit the mark unfortunately. Of course not a bad cigar, but it doesn't resemble the praise I've seen for it. Hopefully this is just batch variation.",3.0,mjmmm,23:

I try to make sure that the cigars are well stored and not dried out. At home I have a small humidor for twelve churchills, which I keep at 72% humidity. 
I particularily like all of the RyJ which come packed in the aluminum tubes with the spanish cedar lining. The cigars come out with such a nice aroma. The Nr.3's are a nice little cigar with a full flavor of the Nr.2's but better for a quick smoke, about 30-45 minutes. The last few I have smoked have had a very even burn and a woody, sweet aromatic taste, just like all of the RyJ tubos. I still have not had any in the humidor for any amount of time, but these seem to have smoked well being new.",0.0,milesvienna,31:

Although machine made these showed considerable care in construction to my way of thinking. Having placed one in the mouth (unlit) and just rolling it around for the ""feel"" of things, brought sweet tastes and some feelings of anticipation of times to come. My thoughts are that this is a wonderful smoke for what it is, and I will continue to have this brand despite some less than enthusiastic reviews.

"April 5, 2016",Romeo y Julieta  Romeo No 2,"  On a recent trip to Cuba I picked up a number 2 with some change in my pocket. I didn't think much of it as it was just cheap cigar I  purchased on a whim. The cigar had some age to it but I thought it would just be a nice cigar to have casually rather than save it. And that I did, on a cold night I lit the cigar and had it with a rum and coffee. I was immediately hit unmissable notes of spice and pepper. This flavour intensified with some wood notes coming through. It was one of the best cigars I had ever smoked, and I even took it right down to the nub. I couldn't wait to get another one. Sadly I couldn't find any that aged again in the UK. So I bought a few boxer in 2015. I have just finished one of these after leaving them in my humidor for 2 months. Sadly without age these cigars just do not have that flavour profile that I was expecting. It had a few mild hints of leather and wood but not that spice I was craving from my aged no.2.

If your cigars were indeed the 2005 EL it could only be the most insignificant of lighter shades - but still maduro and relatively dark. Otherwise they were either counterfeit or regular Romeo y Julieta Belicosos and not these ELs. Presuming they were the correct cigars then any subtle variation in wrapper shade has no difference whatsoever on the flavour; even swapping a maduro wrapper itself for a claro wrapper on a large guage (same blend) Havana cigar would have little effect on even the most tuned-in palette. It all varies, with any fine cigar, on subtle variation in the overall blend, age, roll quality and also the smoker's own relativity/subjectivity.

God forbid they actually sell a cigar rolled with high quality tobacco that doesn't either have a second band on it in a blinged out box or super f'in expensive. In my humble opinion, these are consistently better than every other Corona Gorda Habanos produces....stone fruit, orange rind/ginger root, pekoe tea, honey toast, all dancing around a core of quality tangy, cuban tobacco!  You honestly cannot go wrong purchasing a box or 5 of these but honestly it won't hurt my feelings if you don't.  Keep buying the Mag 46's, Epi #1's, Siglo IV's, and Superiores!

Very smooth cigar,typical high grade mild Cuban tobacco. Last third kinda like the 2nd third but more nutty now with the vegetal flavors fading leading into a light chocolate flavor.Not overly complex, but not a bad thing here. Solid 8. Smoked this stick first, than a RA superiores.Back to back. The RA was superior because I prefer a stronger cigar. But I see why everyone loves the Regios. It did not show much of its youth.

The first half was quite sweet. Caramel notes with sweet fruit balancing well with the spice, almost like smoking a Cameroon wrapper. Flavours intermingle with chocolate and blackpepper. Quite complex and medium-light in body. As the stick progresses, the flavour profile become drier and savoury. Now there is toast, leather and some saltiness reminiscent of a Sancho Panza. The sweet cedar now becomes mellow woodiness. Some intermittent herbal notes and mint, occasional meaty nuaces. Spice levels die down but the smoke becomes increasingly richer, more fuller bodied. Long aftertaste of wood and toasted tobacco. Burns evenly yielding dense white ash. Towards the final quarter, the spice increases. A constantly evolving stick with much complexity.

"November 8, 2010",Romeo y Julieta  Cedros de Luxe No. 2,"  Ok, first up the honesty part - I only bought and sampled 1 stick of this (had it in my humidor for 1 month prior to smoking) so my experience isn't necessarily a reflection of the overall standard of these.

The good: size is excellent for a quick-ish yet unrushed smoke (around 45 minutes or so).  Construction is ok with some prominent veins showing. Draw for me was good, not too tight, not too loose, medium but on the looser end of the scale.

The bad: Very uneven burn which needed to be corrected several times.

The Taste: Initially very nutty, little bit woody with a touch of cedar.  Medium bodied.  Settled down a bit in the 2nd third to a bit more mellow flavour.  Still nutty but creaminess coming through. Final 3rd was ok, went a bit spicier and earthier as expected but still underlying flavours of dark roast nuts came through although no longer as smooth.

The verdict: Ok cigar for the price but really I smoked this cigar and a monte 4 one after another and the class and construction of the monte totally blew this one away.  Considering monte 4s are way cheaper in Australia ($17-ish vs $22 ish per stick) I won't be buying anymore of these in a hurry.",3.0,hsche6,27:

I had always wanted to try a RyG and I thought the day would have been perfect for it. Honestly, I was a bit disappointed, but only by the conditions the shop left it in. Some jackass left the humidor open and the cigar had become too dry for my taste. Didn't cut good and the wrapper came undone (Luckily, I was able to get that under control). However, this did not keep me from enjoying the cigar. By far, the strongest cigar I've had. It had a good bold, robust flavor with a good strong spice and earthy tones. The draw was wonderful, considering the condition (I imagine a properly cared #2 would be perfect). A bit too fast burning that I would have preferred.

"August 6, 2008",Romeo y Julieta  Cedros de Luxe No. 3,"I've just smoked my first Cedros de Luxe in an informal atmosphere, so here's an informal review.
After a not too clean cut (the mouthend was slightly dry) I took a few draws. To my relief the draw was perfect, but the taste was quite as I expected: cedar. How could it not be, with the cigar having rested in its cedar sleeve and being an RyJ. I decided not to force it into neutrality and lit it up with the cedar wrapping.
The initial flavour of the smoke was intensely aromaticwith cedar, as it is so often in this brand. Now while this is a classical cigar aroma and can be seen as a plus, I've come to dread it a bit. Cedar tends to be quite dominant, too prominently present on the tip of the tongue. Maybe a side-effect of over-indulgence in Romeo no. 3s. But just as I was about to become judgmental and dismiss it as a slightly souped-up version of that line, after an inch of burn, things picked up. Strength took a step back and tagged over to a welcome fresher taste... that of good Cuban tobacco that doesn't get in its own way.
The rest of the cigar mostly kept progressing in this direction. Good Cuban smoke, thick with flavour and rich in the nose. Surprisingly, it managed to stay on the ""clean"" side nearly all of this time. It flirted with a certain gruffness, the cedar lingering in the background at any moment, but never exploded into bitterness or actual roughness.
The end, after a rather satisfactory duration of smoking, was short and to the point: a woody aroma (this time drier, less sweet and more intricate than the cedar) took over and bid me goodnight as the cigar came to its finish.
This was no extraordinary cigar. But it was very good in what it set out to do. While there may be many similar experiences in the vast Cuban spectrum, and indeed the Romeo no. 3 can provide equal satisfaction when you're lucky to have a particularly neat one at a much lower price, I really can imagine that some people would feel grief if this little stick were to disappear. Particularly because it was simply a very pleasant, unpretencious smoke that exactly because of this could become a polished gem with some aging. My initial suspicions that this was a somewhat unrequired part of the RyJ line-up are washed away. Instead, this cigar is like the little grocery store around the corner that you'd hate to see muscled out by the big warehouses: it may be nothing too special, but perhaps it's just your taste.

Cigar started with great complexity and perfect balance. After little more than one centimeter taste of nuts appeared. This was one of the greatest transformations from light to medium body.

"September 10, 2013",Ramon Allones  Especial de Allones,"  I read here and in other web sites taht Ramon Allones made two campana in his recent history: this one in 2008-2009 for France and the one called Belicosos for UK, Belgium and maybe Germany in 2011-2012.
I have a box of Ramon Allones campana of 2002 that a friend of mine taken for me casually in an Havana shop. The box is typical of Ramon Allones brand with the name od Specially Selected (the famous robusto of RA) but the size of the box is different longer than a box of robustos. Inside 25 campanas with RA anilla, maybe it is a false for an example other campana cigars with RA anilla or is a sperimental box maybe becouse some years later RA produced a RA Especial de Allones and RA Belicosos. I cannot be sure but taste, flavour, intensity of this cigar is similar to the general characters of RA brand. I affined in Humidor and smoked 15 of this cigars. Now I preserve the box with more or less 10 cigars. If someone is interest of this ""mistery"" or know something other information plase write here a comment.",4.0,aldo-red-smoker,3:
"September 10, 2013",Ramon Allones  Especial de Allones,"  Ramon Allones Especial de Allones and the other campana cigar of Ramon Allones named Belicosos, are one strange mistery in my experience. The Especial de Allones is limited, as Cigars Review supposed, in a few thousand of boxes hand made in 2008-2009 for France and Belicosos in a unknown number of boxes for UK, Germany, maybe Belgium in 2011-12. This what I have find on web about a campna shape of Ramon Allones. The mistery is that in 2002 a friend of mine return back from Cuba giving me a box of Ramon Allones with the name Specially Selected but the box have uncommon size for 25 robustos like Specially Selected. When I have open the box I found 25 little piramides of Ramon Allones the cigars are figurados and the size 152 x 52. The box was large more or less than the one of Specially Selected but the other is longer (about 142-145 mm)respect at the normal box of robustos. After ten years I read on your site that there were be limited productions of RA campana, but after 2004. So the production of Ramon de Allonnes campana vitola did not exist in 2002.
I think that the box that I have in my humidor with about 7-8 cigars I smoked the others was or a false for an example 25  Romeo Y Juleta campana (Belicosos) with Ramon Allones anillas or an experimental box of the future cigars of this shape. The fact that the box has the name of Specially Selected and the flavour, taste and intensity very similar to other vitolas of Ramon Allones and different to any campana that I have never somoked.

"August 7, 2010",Ramon Allones  Belicosos,  This stick was one of two cigars I got out of box 453/2000 from the German limited edition (exclusivo alemania). They look absolutely beautiful with a medium dark wrapper and an exquisite cap. Cutting the cigar revealed very tightly rolled tabaco. Lighting up the cigar was a little difficult as it burned unevenly and the first few draws were very hard. Once lit up properly the cigar produced a decent amount of smoke. The first third of the stick was smooth with woody undertones but it lacked the full flavor and complexity I was expecting from it. It was a little bland. The second third came in strong with a very pronounced coffee flavor delivering the same kick that a double espresso first thing in the morning will give you. The last part was rich and peppery creating a tingly sensation on the lips. To me these sticks need to age a whole lot more to develop their full potential. I will bury the second stick deep into my humidor to try it again in a few years. It was not a bad smoke but for me it needs to ripen out more to be enjoyed fully. That said I will get a box to let them age properly because I think these cigars have a lot of potential. For me they are just not completely there yet.,3.5,3kus,8:

Woody flavours, mixed with coffee.  Tight draw.  Overall, alright, for the length and the price.",4.0,agraupe,5:

"April 14, 2013",Sancho Panza  Sanchos,  A fine cigar with flavors adding and building the entire length without becoming overbearing or harsh. Even a whiff of Armagnac midway through. Excellent construction with an even burn and smooth draw for 2.5 hours.,5.0,miskis,27:
"January 23, 2013",Sancho Panza  Sanchos,"  Smoked the first one...The experince lasted almost 3 hours...the first half was sublime,sweet,herbal ,refined.The draw,burn and taste were perfect.The second half had some burn problems and its strength amplified,but still a very easy cigar to smoke despite its size.",4.5,kamaz,26:
"May 3, 2013",Sancho Panza  Escuderos,"  I finds this cigar perfectly. The construction is excellent, burn well. Prelit taste is sweet. Produces plenty of smoke. Creamy and slightly spicy deep taste, mild to medium in strenght. But I smoked only one. It has the potential for aging, see you later. Box MRA Jun 11. Different than the others Sancho that I smoked. I can recommend, I was not disappointed.",4.5,kml,2:
"August 19, 2016",Sancho Panza  Molinos,"  A very good cigar. Halfway trough an aged box and all have been very mild, subtle but tasty and mellow. Nice woody bitter-sweet aromas and the salty notes.",4.5,titobueno76,20:

"August 26, 2016",Sancho Panza  Non Plus,"Just reasonable. Fine draw, slight earth and tobbaco flavous with a hint of salt (an interesting aspect of this cigar). Not intense flavours. The great score only comes in the end, with a long and pleasant aftertaste of more than 6 hours (never since have I had such a feeling). For those wanting to know what aftertaste means, try these.",3.5,heinrich,26:
"May 24, 2014",Sancho Panza  Non Plus,"My box date was MAR 13 so the young tobacco was ever present with a deep earth note. With a few years of age these cigars will mellow. Saltiness in the first third stuck out, then a nice sweet grassy note lingered, developing into earth flavours. Much enjoyment.",3.5,marcel-z,25:
"April 26, 2013",Sancho Panza  Non Plus,"  A modest, mild-flavored cigar with taste of salt. Progresses towards medium bodied with some vanilla at the end. Not a bad smoke, just nothing special.",3.5,miskis,24:
"May 30, 2012",Sancho Panza  Non Plus,"  Interesting cigar. The most outstanding particular is the very noticeable salty taste covering the back of the mouth. Overall a mild smoke, woody on both flavour and aroma, it stays mild and subtle throughout all the smoke, intensifying the salty notes at the end. You really need to concentrate while smoking, otherwise it will just feel bland. Some sticks had a tight draw.",3.5,titobueno76,23:
"November 20, 2011",Sancho Panza  Non Plus,"  Just tried these for the first time - first impressions are that these are a cigar with real personality.
Many of the usual cuban flavours on show, earth, coffee, cream, spice but with a sharper, more savoury tang. 
Its such a shame that the stick I tried was very tightly rolled and required some effort to get a decent draw. That being said the flavours were wonderful so it deserves a good score.
I have another sitting in my humi that seems a little looser so hopefully might be even better than this one.

"May 5, 2013",Sancho Panza  Coronas Gigantes,"  2003 - A classic with a light colorado wrapper, perfect construction and burn, grey/white ash and around 100 minutes of bliss.

"March 15, 2012",Sancho Panza  Coronas Gigantes,"  DTF JUN03 - Excellent Churchill, almost Juan Lopes, if Cuba ever made one, medium strength, light body, salty biscuits, musky side taste.

"October 4, 2016",Sancho Panza  Belicosos,"This pyramid is very very good. The SP flavours - that in other SP cigars, like the Non Plus, are very subtle - are here very obvious (with the classic salt and some cinnamon). Still, a light to medium power cigar. Considering the quality-price relation, this is a must on every humidor.",4.0,heinrich,82:
"March 19, 2015",Sancho Panza  Belicosos,"  Was gifted to me for my b-day. Very low expectations. This cigar is a very good stick. Toasted nuts, chocolate and a hint of pepper. Very smooth creamy smoke,and a bit of salt left on the lips. Leagues ahead of its little bro Non Plus. This cigars body was a medium body. Med/Full at times. Not overly complex but when the flavor profile is this good, who cares about complexity. Overall great cigar. Box worthy all day long. Easily a 92 point stick. Thanks Heath",4.5,purophene,81:
"January 9, 2015",Sancho Panza  Belicosos,"  Nice draw &amp; burn. Quite tasty for a medium light pyramid, although the last inch and a half is getting bitter (I smoke my cigars to the last inch...). It's length makes it easy to smoke with a short drink, in the afternoon. Amongst my eight favourite Cuban.",4.0,beto,80:
"March 24, 2013",Sancho Panza  Belicosos,"  First tried this a couple years ago, and was impressed with draw and burn, light honey and cinnamon flavours, dry tobacco.  Picked up a box from 2011 and lit one up.  Think it needs some TLC in the humidor to regain the flavour, all I was really getting was dry tobacco.",3.5,oldmanjohnson,79:
"July 29, 2012",Sancho Panza  Belicosos,"  This cigar is very underrated in my opinion. It has more delicious flavours than most, and a consistent, burn-nice construction on those I have tried, put this slightly rustic but oh such a pleasure to smoke cigar among my top three Belicosos, Cuban or NC. 9+",4.5,gentle_rebel,78:

"August 24, 2010",Sancho Panza  Bachilleres,"  At first glance this stick looks well made, and though the colorado wrapper isn't the finest in the cuban world the construction seems  flawless. The beginning really surprised me, this little boy packs some power indeed! And good although raw earthy flavours, with nice coffee notes. The draw and burning are good, just remember not to wait too long between your puffs. Halfway through the stick this cigar becomes slightly sweeter and some cedar flavour emerges; the earthy base is still well present but you  start to detect a complexity unusual in such small formats. Strenght is always present while burning becomes a little uneven, but nothing to worry about. Towards the end it  can become a little bitter in a pleasant way, adding  some more ""punch"".
All in all a good cigar: not refined or complex like more expensive and classy products of course, but really good for a morning smoke or for beginners.",3.5,sasha,19:
"July 12, 2010",Sancho Panza  Bachilleres,"  A core melody of cedar, leather, salt, earth all the way through; and ligero grassiness tuning in but quickly replaced by the hearty meatiness of an honest man's meal. I was surprised to really enjoy this cigar, it was unexpectedly complex, and it lasted a decent while too as it was packed to the gunnels with tobacco. I would give it an A verging on A+, it did everything that was asked of it; but then trumped that with surprising complexity and evolution of flavour, and smoothness throughout.",4.0,frenchkiwi,18:

"September 2, 2015",San Cristobal de La H.  Muralla,"  Fabulous cigar. Initial hay taste develops into a flavors of cocoa and light spice. Medium bodied, theres a subtle complexity that lasts for the entire length of the smoke.
