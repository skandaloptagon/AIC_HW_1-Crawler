"June 7, 2010",Cuaba  Tradicionales,"First review...
I smoked one of these while strolling around the grounds of a beautiful hotel converted from an old castle in north Wales. Sadly the cigar did not match the experience. As many people have already said, it was brutally plugged and I ended up abandoning it long before I usually would. The way the format allows the flavour to develop as the gauge increases is certainly interesting, however this cigar failed to take full advantage of this with pleasant but plain tobacco and wood flavours.
It is worth mentioning that this cigar came from a rather meagre selection of habanos in a small humidor in the hotel bar, so may not be idicative of all of these. However, I have tried other Cuabas from the shop I work in (where i know they are kept well) and have experienced similar problems.",2.0,dreadary,29:

A very nice little cigar that maintained much of its potency despite its advanced age.  Floral and notes of ginger dominated the first two inches, followed by a heavier taste of dried fruit in the second third.  The final third produced strong tastes of spice such as mustard and some hardwoods as well.  This was a real treat to smoke.  Very well balanced as it delivered its various tastes.

Lots of mixed toasty, cedar, white pepper, exotic tasting spiciness and sweet cacao and coffee aromas. It is noteworthy that the typical Cuban earthiness is almost absent with these ones.

"September 16, 2016",Trinidad  Reyes,From a 2015 box. My first reyes. 14 weeks rest in my humidor at 65%. Initial flavors upon lighting were sweet spicey honey/caramel. Body increased to medium with creme brule and roasted nuts and a medium nicotine kick. Ash was flaky throughout. The finish is a pleasing burnt sugar note. Decent smoke but needs more rest.,3.5,jack0846,136:
"July 3, 2016",Trinidad  Reyes,Bought a pack of five and wasn't particularly impressed with the first three which seemed a bit green and nondescript. I don't know what happened but the next one having been left in the humidor for a few months and smoked outside on a lovely sunny afternoon was a real beauty. A flavour bomb that smelt as good as it tasted. Burn was a little inconsistent but I may have the humidity too high at 70%?

I was expecting a stronger smoke from my experience with ELs in general, but this is a more seductive experience. Starts off chocolatey and aromatic. The quality is immediately apparent with a broad spectrum of complexity that tingles the senses.

"January 3, 2015",Vegas Robaina  Unicos,"If anyone's been reading my reviews so far, you might know that shiny bands attract me like a dumb raccoon to a quarter in a trap.  Maybe it's a bit silly of me, but none the less I like shiny and I like torpedoes so I decided to give this a try.
Construction held together fine, but I had to relight several times, which is odd considering how loose the draw was.  After so many relights, I felt like the flavour was a bit ruined.  Every 3/4 of an inch required a touch up or a relight.
The initial flavour was a nice creamy, sweet coffee.  I had just smoked a Montecristo Open Eagle last week, so I was bit tired of coffee flavours, but it was slightly different, so rather pleasant.  After that, the lighting issues started.  I feel like I burned through this at an odd pace.  The second third was a bit smokey tasting due to how charred the tobacco was at this point.  Imagine coffee and burning wood.  The final third was weak in flavour.
I was really disappointed by this cigar.  Maybe it was a bit too moist, maybe the construction was a bit poorer than I thought, I don't know.  I'm not gonna bother trying again with it.  I'm not gonna recommend this to others.  Get the PSP2 or Montecristo #2 if you want a good torpedo/piramide.",2.5,wraffles,102:

Despite being touted as a fuller bodied marque, I found this particular stick quite mild in flavour and light in body. Quite a contrast to the No.1 and No. 2. On the tongue, mainly freshly brewed black coffee with aromatic wood and some dryish, cedary notes. But on the nose, very floral, sweet and fragrant, freshly cut grass and incense. Some citrusy nuances creep in towards the final third. One of those sticks that you must enjoy with your mouth and your nose. Ever present spice on the tongue. Surprisingly thick and voluminous smoke for such a small, delicate stick. Deceptively long. Very well made and burns even. More of an aperitif cigar and a good one at that.

Then again, it might very well be dust and mold. In any case it wiped off easily enough without leaving a mark but I digress.
Anyway, it is quite an elegantly made short panatela with a smooth, colorado wrapper. Burns even with a workable draw. Overall flavours are mainly earth and wood with some dark chocolate and coffee. Not much sweetness and about a medium bodied smoke. Burnt nice and even. With some care, it did not overheat. Overall, the smoke was quite good actually.

I can barely notice any veins among the filler when I clip the stick. Burns dead even and draws like a dream with just enough resistance to remind you that you are smoking a cigar. With time in the humidor, the flavours have become progressively stronger as with the spice levels. The flavour profile has also changed, becoming slightly drier.

A well rolled smoke, god draw all the way through, an even burn and well sized ash before it dropped so indicating a construction that can take the test of time. 
The flavour was excellent for the first third, smooth and aromatic with a medium flavour - indicative of spice and leather. the second third developed the flavour - bringing in a classic pepper and slightly bitter (I say this in a good way) flavour. However, I left the cigar and then returned to it for the final third and the flavour had become over-developed and not as good as the mid point.

Anyway, stuck it in the humidor for 3 months. Finally caved in to temptation and got one out today after dinner.

Prelit aroma of earthy hay and milk chocolate. Well made and the wrapper looks darker than usual HDMs. Clipped it to make a small hole as HDMs tend to be light in body and I was hoping for a greater concentration of the smoke.

First third was light with sweet woody tones and a tinge of leather. As it progresses to the second third, there is more leather and toasty flavours creep in, yet the sweet woodiness remains. With the final third, the body steps up a notch. Around the last quarter, the smoke becomes slightly tannic.

Even with the smaller than usual hole, the draw was excellent. The burn is even. Plenty of smoke but it is rather light in body. Excellent flavours and perfumy aroma prevail throughout. Elegant and not overpowering. A cigar for the day rather than for the night in my opinion. One for the golf course or party rather than solitary contemplation.",4.5,sengjc,34:

"August 20, 2011",Hoyo de Monterrey  Le Hoyo du Dauphin,"Smoked a couple of these marvellous panatelas recently courtesy of a friend in the cigar business. An absolute must for anyone appreciating elegant pre-XXI style blends. 

The cigars I smoked had good eight-ten years on them spent in proper humidified conditions.

Impeccable construction and steady well-paced burning. Having said that, it was to a larger extent due to my friend carefully selecting a couple of cigars for me from a good dozen of them. These panatelas have always been known for rather unstable construction quality, which was one of the reasons sighted to me for their discontinuation by Habanos. There is a point of view, however, that with age even tighter-rolled cigars improve in their draw, which allows for the ones normally unsmokable to improve in that respect.

Elegant somewhat spicy taste, which is nicely sustained throughout the entire smoking. A hint of saltiness for the first third of the cigar. The taste soon comes second after the more well-defined and dominating aroma with notes of stronger spiced tea and heated wood.

A medium cigar, it can, however, become instantly bitter with strength if overburned by a hasty after-lunch smoker. Requires a good 40 minutes of careful thoughtful smoking to allow it to give at its own pace.
The last third of the cigar develops a rather unexpected and very enjoyable powerful presence of vanilla sweetness in the aroma, without the taste actually becoming sweet. Leaves a very distinct airy and somewhat minty aftertaste typical for noble old tobacco and one of those old school blends, which are these days rare to find in modern releases of Habanos.

A delightful experience for anyone fond of lower key sophisticated panatelas. Of course, if you are able to get hold of them at all (and especially of the ones, which were stored properly) as they were discontinued in 2003.

"April 25, 2016",Hoyo de Monterrey  Epicure Especial LE 2004,"  What a harmonious cigar. Dried herbs, dried fruits, roasted nuts, potpourri. It's all very complex and tough to pin down -- like walking into a small shop that sells all those things and just taking a big whiff. The taste of the wrapper especially has a delicious and complex sweetness that is tough to pin down. Later a creamy sandalwood essence and a bit of citrusy furniture polish appear. Extremely persistent flavors that resonate and tingle the taste buds. Intoxicating aromas. Razor sharp burn and easy draw reminiscent of Behike. Come to think of it, this cigar tastes a lot like Behike as well. Luxurious and relaxing. No harshness. Feels like smoking nothing at all. 

I always keep a glass of water and a glass of tawny port nearby when I smoke in case my mouth dries out or I need to cleanse my palate of excessive bitterness. I didn't touch either with this cigar. It was never drying and never overpowering. It carries with it enormous complexity and harmony that triggers nostalgia for a place that doesn't exist -- a dreamland if you will.

"February 11, 2017",Hoyo de Monterrey  Epicure No. 2,"  Bought as a single from Havana Express in Sydney.  Good looking stick.  Good construction, nice tobacco smell.  Lit it up and was immediately struck by the creamy coffee flavours and thought immediately that this was going to be one of my favourites.  Tight draw though.  Not insurmountable but need a couple of pulls to generate reasonable smoke.  Coffee flavours fell off pretty quickly though.  Started as mild to medium but went to medium and then on the fullish side for the final third.  No progression from the first third onwards and lost the charm of that first third in the second and final thirds. Greater nicotine bite in the second half which is not my cup of tea. Maybe a bit too young.  Would like to try a more aged sample though to see if those creamy coffee flavours kick through.
Had a with a Sheaf Stout which was probably on the bitter side for this cigar.  Will go with my Leffe Bruine standard in the future.

The smell of decent oak wood and pure tobacco is very pleasant.

So, let's fire up that lil' baby. The first draws reveal a very intensive and strong taste. Wow... I hadn't expected it by a cigar of that age which is also said to be on the light side. Flavors of roasted nuts and coffee, wood, tobacco and leather are present from the very beginning. It starts with a beat of the drum! The combination is very well balanced and the flavors get more intensive and fade away in a very interesting interaction.

The second third is mainly characterized by woody and herbal components... sometimes a aroma of mushrooms joins.....

The last third shows what it really is: tobacco, pure tobacco. And that is the taste... old, pure tobacco... to be honest: that's what I would expect, 'cause in the end it is just a cigar.

The smoke was very thick, creamy... almost fat! The draw was perfect over the whole smoking time of 80 minutes, the burn-off was ruler-straight.

Very impressive, but also strangely reminding of Honduras taste profiles - that bittersweet creamyness, that velvet structure... Highly interesting, and clean tasting throughout.

"November 12, 2016",Cuaba  Salomones,"  I purchased a box of 10 from the LCDH in Berlin. As a quick side note, the Berlin team is absolutely amazing. Wonderful service by them. Box date was Oct. 2014. The construction of these cigars is immaculate. A slight bit of plume, which I love to see and tells me the Berlin team is doing it right. No discoloration at all. Perfect firmness when squeezed and the aromas pre-light are everything you want and more. I was so excited that I snipped a bit more than I usually do, so my draw was a little fuller than I'd normally prefer, but it didn't make a difference. Pre-light draw doesn't smack you in the face and is actually quite pleasant. I love the double figurado construction of these babies, because it forces you to be patient and let everything develop. Since this was my first time smoking them, I wasn't really focusing on the specific flavor profiles, but rather the overall feeling it gave me, like the slight tingling sensation the smoke leaves on the tongue etc. Having previously smoked Divinos from Cuaba, I was expecting the same wonderful flavors and was by no means disappointed. Perhaps with a slightly smaller cut, those flavors will become more evident, but that's for the next time. A definite hour and half to two hour cigar, so don't smoke this if you're in a rush, it's too good to waste.

It smelled great out of the coffin with that heady cuban smell. It was beautifully constructed with a nice, oily wrapper -- no plugs or soft spots. The draw -- which is my biggest concern whenever I get a legit cubano --  was smooth and easy. First part of the cigar was a little underwhelming... a little light on the smoke and not as flavorful as I had been hoping. As I got into the first third, however, it started getting very nice. A woody-vanilla flavor with that mingled with that creamy carmel smoke that is a relative constant with all the quality habanos I've tasted. As we moved down the stick both the flavors and the smoke intensified. I took it to the nub because it was such a nice smoke. Finished it in about 2.5 hours or so. I agree with OscarC below.

A little bland at first, she began to open up after about 15mins with some nice white pepper and leathery tones and a half hour in she really warmed up as well. Comments from colleagues on the smoke\'s aroma were positive. After 45 mins I finally understood what a lot of reviewers have said about construction flaws with Upmanns as I hit a plug, lost draw and had to relight. This happened consistently in the last half/third of the stick (4 relights all told) and whilst tolerable in a cheaper smoke, I don\'t expect it in \""better\"" Cubans. Overcame the plugs finally to suck her down to the nub while nursing some Turkey &amp; water. Can\'t really judge on the basis of one experience but I am having reservations about the Monarcas now and will carry a back-up when I do pull it. Apart from the sub-par (at this price range) wrapper and construction issues, this mild smoke suited the cocktail party well - would be a bit light for an after dinner toke though in my opinion.

Ever since smoking my first Sir Winston I've had a love affair with this cigar. A classic among classics. I prefer this Julieta No 2 over all others. The look and smell alone let's you know you are in for a treat before lighting. A colorado wrapper, smooth, with an oily sheen. Upon clipping the cap a craftsmans dimple is present, letting you know a professional roller spent time rolling this quality cigar. The cigar is firm with just the right amount of give present when tenderly squeezing between the thumb and index. A perfect draw lends me to believe this will be an exquisite hour and a half. Immediately I'm greater with strong toasted tobacco, light leather, bread, and roasted almonds. The cigar progresses smoothly, leaving a silky and creamy finish. Many others trip over themselves tracking down Edplendidos but I prefer the Sir Winston. Although they can be hard to find throughout the year, I stock up when I can.

Do yourself a favor and pay the little extra for the Petit's if you want to smoke a true, crisp Havana.",3.5,owensinco,17:
"April 28, 2015",H. Upmann  Regalias,"  This is probably the best petit corona coming out of Cuba today, no question about it. I can't see paying $150-180 for a box of Upmann or Bolivar ""petit coronas"" when I can pay anywhere from $96-125 for a box of Regalias and get the same quality/texture of tobacco and alot of times get a better blended cigar with a Regalias! I think today, more than ever, the educated buyer/smoker knows that there is little to no difference between all of the petit coronas except for bands/presentation and price. Otherwise you're just as likely to get a great box of petit coronas buying a box of Regalias as you are buying a box of Siglo 2's. Maybe after the cigars have aged 7-8 years or more, the blends will blossom and seperate themselves, distinguish themselves from each other more, but if you plan on smoking the cigars within a year or two, you would be very, very hard pressed to be able to discern between one petit corona and another. The only differences you are going to experience between one brand versus another are the same differences you would see from one box to another of the same brand/vitola. So it boils down to what you're willing to spend and really it makes no sense whatsoever to buy the petit coronas that go for$150+ except for just saying you have those brands Iin your cabinet. The Regalias usually always have a bakers spice/herbal/leatherey/wheat toast and coffee-like aroma and flavor, especially when you retrohale throughout the smoke. The tobacco is usually always of a very good to great quality and has a velvety, leathery texture to it and this all holds true from box to box to box, making it, in my extensive experience with this particular cigar, a very consistently produced cigar in an industry/market of highly inconsistent cigars coming out of Cuba today. You cannot go wrong in purchasing a box of H. Upmann Regalias and if you're the type that subscribes and follows what other ""cigar gurus"" say, MRN claims this is one of the best cigars to age when it comes to the benefit recieved from the additional years accrued on the cigar, but he was also referring to the machine-made version, which I feel was quite a different cigar than to what the Regalias is today. Today, I feel it is even higher quality as far as the blend and texture of the tobaccos used to roll the Regalias, which produces a much better cigar both for current consumption and for delayed gratification.",4.5,tonyaccardo,16:
"March 8, 2011",H. Upmann  Regalias,"Everyone who is on a quest of finding a good cuban cheapie should consider trying the H.Upmann Regalias.

This Upmann features a boxpressed shape with lighter brown oily wrappper that exhibits an  excellent barnyard smell. Flavor base is medium bodied and consists of coffee, herbal, leather, creamy and sweet notes with just a little spice in the first third. I would consider the strenght of this cigar to be a medium. Construction is top notch except the burn seems to be a bit too fast on these cigars. Smoking time was about 1h and 15 minutes.

"March 10, 2006",H. Upmann  Petit Upmann,"This cigar is really a bit of a rough diamond. how anyone can say that this cigar is ""light"" or for beginners is suprising! I would certailny not recommend this stick to a beginner, unless of course you want to put them off cigars for life....may be a good thing though...do them a favour, save them some money and their marriage!! this stick is a scorching powerhouse right from the start...piercing flavour of burnt toast which is also very sour at the same time. The flavours come later on and are primarily dark chocolate moist earthy notes always with that sour afterburn on the middle to tip of the tongue. Its aroma is sort of fruity floral and herbaceous. Meanwhile the strength just gets greater right to the end until actually it does get a bit bucolic and tarry with the enevitable build up of oils in such a strong smoke. as you smoke the heaviness of the smoke crawls slowly down your throat and onto your chest (no I don't inhale). although this probably sounds like I'm giving this stick a bad review I'm not. This is a cigar for lovers of the strength of tobacco and is quite unlike anything else in the Upmann line-up. Its really more about the strenght than the flavour and as such will only appeal to certain palettes. They can sometimes suffer with a tight draw and some boxes are made up of very light insipid coloured wrappers which certainly don't appeal to me so check them first before you buy! This cigar can be enjoyed with a cup of strong sweet proper coffee at breakfast, on a brisk walk in the winter with the dogs, say after lunch, or equally well after a good curry...but never on an empty stomach! it would make an excellent nightcap. word of warning though..because it is so hard hitting on the palatte, any sticks you smoke on the same day subsequent to this one will not taste as you're used to. Finally the ""Corona Junior"" is the same sized cigar, but in a tube, so you pay a bit more for the aluminium! I once smoked one from a tube and it tasted even stronger than what I have described above, so don't know if its a slightly different blend with more ligero in it. what is for sure though is that these sticks could probably take some serious ageing!...""Hold on to your hats!""

The anise was a challenge but the experience was lifted by the salt, but the overall experience was one of refinement. In the second third, and towards the halfway point, the leather took over from the wood and the anise mellowed into a kind of herbal oil which seemed to take away the dryness. This was altogether much more enjoyable, although the flavours were still mild rather than bold. The strength crept up to medium towards the final third, and the wood and leather became more evenly balanced, which is to say the wood increased, as did the anise, but nowhere near the level of the first third, and it was joined by a touch of spice.

Upmanns of current lines. Not very well made and burnt quite unevenly with underfilled sections. Starts of fine with typical H.

"October 8, 2010",Romeo y Julieta  Cedros de Luxe No. 1,"  Tried a single stick from the 02 after painstakingly bringing it back to life in my humidor. It was quite dry when I purchased it on a whim a number of months back, one of the few remaining of the box. The absence of any prelit aroma did not bode well but I proceeded undeterred. The first half was quite sweet. Caramel notes with sweet fruit balancing well with the spice, almost like smoking a Cameroon wrapper. Flavours intermingle with chocolate and blackpepper. Quite complex and medium-light in body. As the stick progresses, the flavour profile become drier and savoury. Now there is toast, leather and some saltiness reminiscent of a Sancho Panza. The sweet cedar now becomes mellow woodiness. Some intermittent herbal notes and mint, occasional meaty nuaces. Spice levels die down but the smoke becomes increasingly richer, more fuller bodied. Long aftertaste of wood and toasted tobacco. Burns evenly yielding dense white ash. Towards the final quarter, the spice increases. A constantly evolving stick with much complexity. Not a typical RyJ but thorouhgly enjoyable. An experience more so than just a casual smoke. I find it odd that people rate it so lowly.",4.5,sengjc,21:

I am a huge fan of the picadores and also the French regional edition (I forget the name) So I thought for 75 euro - what the hell! I am glad I picked them up. At first I couldn't help but feel the size and shape a little redundant. First 5-10 mins are very light. But as I got into it, it developed well. Although this is never going to be particularly complex, it is silky smooth. Crisp burn and draw is great. Right down to the end. Its not going to rock your world or deliver a knock out punch but it is a very pleasing way to spend 35 minutes. I think I will keep these for the rare occasion I smoke in the morning.

"November 23, 2015",Romeo y Julieta  Wide Churchills,"This cigar has consistently been a 7-8 for me and were I interested in spending more of my disposable income this would be my regular smoke. When it first came out it was wonderful. I would have given it an 8 and left it at that. Over the past year or so the quality of the build has gone down a bit and I get a less even burn. I smoke hot (fast) and I find that I am regularly burning my fingers on these since I smoke them right to the end and they don't build up a strong bitterness like some other brands.

A lot of folks have commented on the size and that has to be a part of the allure for these cigars for me. I tend to prefer a larger ring on my cigars and this one seems to hit the mark.

These are your staple R&amp;J with their typical flavour profile. If you like R&amp;J, you will like these. If you prefer something spicier, these will never rate above a 7. 

I read some of the other reviews and they mention letting them age. If you have the patience you should give that a try and see how you feel about it.

One thing I can say - open the box before you buy. I always look for a nice, oily shine. Something a little dark. Those ones seem to be the best from my experience with these (I've probably only smoked about 50-60 of these cigars though so some people will likely have a broader experience) I have a box on hand that I will try and age for a year and see what that does - of course, I will have to try one now, for science and all that.",4.0,robdoyle,24:

Great pre-light aroma. The first few puffs were reminiscent of my first dime store cigars -- very pure tobacco taste. Throughout the smoke everything was lightly aromatic, very smooth and refined. Unfortunately the draw was quite tight, and the underwhelming amount of smoke led to an ashy flavor. 

I don't know if this cigar would benefit from more age. I had high hopes for this one, but it didn't hit the mark unfortunately. Of course not a bad cigar, but it doesn't resemble the praise I've seen for it. Hopefully this is just batch variation.",3.0,mjmmm,23:

I hope no one minds...  These REs are absolutely AMAZING smokes.  I have enjoyed 2 samples so far, and they are some of the BEST smokes I have ever had in my 10 yrs smoking cigars regularly...  Sweet, fruity, earthy, toasty, spicy...  The list goes on &amp; on.  The amazing complexities of these smokes show themselves best when smoked SLOOOWWLLY, so as not to overheat the leaves &amp; release bitter flavors (as with ALL lanceros/panatelas).  Do yourself a favor, make some friends in Germany before they run out!  I wish they were a bit cheaper though, (around $25-30US/stick) but you fully get what you pay for with these.  Unsure of box dates, since I only could afford some singles &amp; a sampler box with 2 of these &amp; 2 of the 5ta Avenida...  I will purchase a cabinet (of 25) as SOON as I can though!  Perfect construction, easy draw with huge pillows of creamy smoke, flavors as noted above, elegant appearance, with no veinage &amp; a flawless wrapper leaf on all my examples so far (about 7)...

First, a great presentation--the tube itself it really nice and old school.  The cigar itself is big and well rolled.  The flavors are classic Bolivar and with 10 years of age now, that classic Bolivar flavor is outstanding.  Never overly strong but always rich and delicious.  If you're lucky enough to find one--grab it.  I haven't seen one for sale in years.  A true 10.",5.0,marc12,14:
"February 6, 2010",Bolivar  Churchills,"  Lovely looking Churchill that came in an aluminium tube. Came at a bargain price as the local LCdH was having a stock clearance last year. Being superceeded by the Corona Gigantes, having quite some age and slight layer of powery white substance, I finally lit it today with much anticipation after sitting in the humidor for about half a year.

However I was sorely disappointed. The cigar had a case of chronic uneven burn. It was poorly constructed, loosely filled and kept going out. Despite my best efforts to rectify this, I ended up wasting about 3 quarters by which time the smoke became overly leathery and tannic. I probably got about ten memorable puffs out of the whole length.

That aside, it did show flashes of brilliance when it did decide to behave. Sweet toasty milk coffee, very flavourful. I hope the box of Corona Gigantes I got recently will be better constructed.

Sadly this is the sole stick and I will be unable to revisit what I believe would have been a brilliant experience. All things considering, I believe a 4/10 score would be fitting and maybe even generous, only because of those few brief interludes I managed to eke out of it.",2.0,sengjc,13:

"September 3, 2015",Bolivar  Colosales,"  I've smoked eleven cigars from this cab since I bought it in 2006. Has changed very little in the eleven years I've had them. On first light the typical Bolivar strength comes through and not much else. These cigars possess a distracting tannic quality that unfortunately never relents for the entire length of the smoke experience. the underlying dark espresso, leather, and earth qualities I usually get from Bolivar are there only subtlety as the smoothness is completely overwhelmed by the aforementioned tannin character. Very frustrating as I want to love these cigars.
Additionally I've had to pitch another four sticks from this box because they were absolute dowels.

The scents are of cocoa and slight chocolate. upon lighting i found that the draw was incredibly tight and struggled to pull a mouthful of smoke from it and the flavours are rather disappointed there is a lot of spice throughout the mouth and a slight harsh feel on the back  of the throat in first third there is a slight creamy taste which fought with the harshness in the second third this disappeared but reappeared briefly at the point of blending between the second and the final third before disappearing again there is also a slight earthy taste throughout the smoke. all in all the flavour isn't particularly complex and is not the greatest and i must agree with a previous reviewer that said it is much alike to a henry winterman half corona which is much cheaper. The burn was good staying level throughout the first two thirds but  spoilt attrociously  in the final  third. The combustion wasn't great either i had to relight it twice with a total burn time of an hour. To summarise this small cigar has a full body and was faultless prior to lighting, it packs a punch for its size but is rather let down by its flavour profile, draw and combustion, however i would try it again incase this was a  bad example its potential.",1.5,holdenjt,29:

"December 18, 2012",Cohiba  Sublimes LE 2004,"(Important Notice: The stick I will be reviewing comes from a bunch of 25 sticks that I purchased after the recommendation of a friend from an non-official retailer. The price for the bunch was 800 US$ and I made all the possible tests that I could imagine in order to verify if they are the authentic ones or not - bands, long filler leaves, smell, color, etc. Still, I am not 100% convinced that they are authentic, they could indeed be of cuban origin, but not from within the factory. Most likely I will never know for sure.)

The cigar was very well constructed and with a perfect burn and medium draw, not to tight and not to easy. Intense throughout, even though the first kick, when lightning up, gave way to a more round and subtle earthly tone of flavors. The ash was light grey and kept hanging on to the cigar for quite some time. Two full hours of smoking this Sublime and the variations on the nose and on the flavor palate where not that great. I missed the creamy Cohiba notes and the evolving spice that I know are some of the characteristics of the brand.

In conclusion, I should say this: This was my first and last purchase from an non-authorised dealer. These Sublimes will remain in my humidor for the years to come, in order to determine if there is any evolution in the aroma and flavor. Even if they are indeed the authentic Sublimes and not just a very good counterfeit, I will always remain with the doubt in my mind.

Overall, I was a bit dissatisfied with this stick. The smoke production was great, but flavor-wise it was pretty bland. More than anything, it just reminded me of a non-Cuban. It had a heavy flabby taste. None of the Partagas spice that I had grown to adore.

Nice puffs and rich smoke. Burning was quite good. Flavour... well, not that great I think. Tobacco, wood and coffee are the flavours that I had mainly had. First third was better than the other 2.

After maybe 5-6 draws it again shifted back to the earth-like taste with slightly stronger pepper taste. Also started to burn really wonky after the midway point.

"July 26, 2008",Partagas  Serie D No. 3 LE 2006,"  I smoke one cigar a day. My - almost -everyday smoke is a R&amp;J Romeo N0.2 (white tubes please!). Since they are relatively cheap, I'm not mad when I purchase a bad batch... On Fridays and special occasions, I treat myself with a Montecristo No.1 or a Cohiba, for example. Today I bought a Partagas Serie D EL 2006. My expectations were high, my dopamine level way up and my mouth watering at the sight and pre-lit smell of that gorgeous oily beauty. I thought my taste buds would explode after a few drags of a real Partagas. Alas, my dream of perfection is still not a reality. This stick must have had a construction flaw, because it gave me a hard time. It didn't burn evenly ans was obviously too wet: it died at least 5 times despite my continuous attention. It's not a good thing to suck too hard on a Partagas, because it kills your gums and tongue... Only the last third was great and managed to give me a creamy satisfaction with plenty of smoke and true complexity. Overall, it was an average, overpriced cigar.",2.0,franz-eric,23:
"July 25, 2008",Partagas  Serie D No. 3 LE 2006,I was given one of these last night and what a fantastic smoke it was. To me it was very much like the old style Partagas with a little more strength and flavour. It had strong earthy &amp; peppery flavours for the first half and then seemed to end up with a light sugary sweet note for the second half all the while keeping me very interested for the whole 45 minutes. Will buy a box definetely. Does anyone know if the limited bands come with an embossed or a smooth version like the SD No2 LE. I am aware that reviewer 19(bigyesta) on the SD No2 LE page mentioned that the embossed label was a better quality version for this cigar. I would like to know if this is true for the SD No3 LE also.

Now at the 5 year mark these have really developed into something special. Plumes of heavy blue smoke with a wonderful aroma. The flavor is very heay and rich almost meat and mushroom dense complex flavors. I hung in there with these the last few years and I am very glad I did.

"July 19, 2007",Partagas  Serie D No. 3 LE 2001,"I was a little disappointed with the D3 but to its defense I had just smoked a Cohiba Genios.  Two cigars of this stature should not be smoked back-to-back.  I found the D3 more similar to the D2 than the D4.  Indeed, the cigar was packed a little too tight and as a result the draw wasn't optimum.  I found the first half more light than the second half.  I more thoroughly enjoyed the second half, but again, perhaps my palate hadn't adjusted to this cigar.  I've got a few more of these so I'll look forward to enjoying it under more optimum conditions.  Until then, I'm only giving this an average rating because a good cigar should stand out especially after smoking a milder cigar, as is the case with the Genios.",3.5,cookj1,26:

The cigar had a nice silky feel to the wrapper and oils from it had soaked into and stained, the ringband. I love it when that happens. When I cut it, the end was somewhat firm and the prelight draw was a little tight, but when it was lit it gave off good volumes of smoke(thank God! until the last inch and a half when it just wouldn't stay lit because of the firm pack at the end. Anyway, the taste, strong espresso, cocoa, cedar and citrussy spice. This cigar has almost everything. And it is one of my go to cigars.

I'm usually a fan of Partagas but this thing almost made me sick. Also it had a very hard draw. Only nice thing I can say about it is that it had a nice aroma which is the Partagas hallmark but that too went away near the second half.,0.5,dusko007,3:
"February 10, 2007",Partagas  Petit Coronas Tubos,"This is where the Partagas Petit Coronas go to die.  I like the whole idea of tubos - the freshness and the portability.  I've had the Upmann tubo and, while it's not the greatest cigar around, it's tasty and convenient.  The Partagas, on the other hand is not.  I gave it two points on appearance - the wrapper is nice and dark with a bit of tooth, veiny but not rustic.  The burn is decent. End of the good things.

  The box date was September '05 and I know it's not well aged, but I've smoked Juan Lopez PC's younger than this and they at least were flavorful.

The cigar is acidic on the tongue like it was sprayed with something.  The first half has an earthiness that is uncomfortable along with a sourness from time to time.  The second half settles down into smokeability but I don't think that if you were given one of these in a blindsmoke, you would even be able to tell that it was Cuban.

There's a chance that aging would help the cigar, but some cigars never get better and I believe this is going to be one of them.

"March 25, 2015",Partagas  Petit Coronas Especiales,"  Nice construction,  nice smoke and burn but I don't understand what people talk about when they say ""old Partagas flavor""?!? I honestly think most cigar smokers try to project the image that they are much more refined in their tastes when they try attributing characteristics to certain vitolas of different marcas, when the truth is that most all cuban cigars are pretty much the same and the only differences you get are those that are naturally going to be evident within a natural, hand-made product. These are just a typical, buttery, toasty, tangy cuban cigar.

"January 28, 2015",Cohiba  Panetelas,"  I think the Cohiba Panatela is a misunderstood cigar. The older ones sometimes have what looks like a ""fake"" band--note the picture on this page, the Cohiba stripe cuts through a row of white dots. One of the quirks of Cuban cigar construction. When they are on, they provide a rich reward of sweet honey, vanilla, and mocha, pure Cohiba goodness. But they are delicate and can lose their draw unless smoked under ideal conditions. Dry box or store them a bit dry before smoking. Smoke indoors unless the humidity and wind are low. Puff delicately and don't get the head wet. I find that if I violate any of these rules, I get a bad draw and muted flavors. It's an outstanding cigar with sufficient age and careful smoking.

That cigar was as creamy, sweet, chocolatey and delicious as any full size cigar, more even.  The 2011 cigar I had this week was strong, full bodied and rich, but NOT quite up to the standard.

"October 6, 2015",Cohiba  Lanceros,"  A class act of a smoke,no question! Started off straight on medium with all that honeyed and grassy flavour that's so synonymous with the marque.There's a very marked difference also between the draw flavours and the flavours on the retrohale.The cigar develops and changes as you smoke through it and by the final third you have a lovely burnt honey flavour combined with a nutty and herbaceous quality.Consistently smooth throughout and it always leaves a lovely sweetness on the lips.A cigar that absolutely must be smoked slowly and so therefore a surprisingly long smoke,a good couple of hours in this case.Not one of my staples by any means,firstly because of the cost but primarily because I just personally don't have the patience needed to wait for the length of ageing time that these undoubtedly need,having put such a big hole in my credit card.Personal experience has informed me that most Cohiba cigars without a minimum of 5 years of age can be very bitter and unpleasant.That being said,an occasional aged box spilt amongst friends has left me with a few that are certainly going to be enjoyed on the here and there as this one has been.A very good cigar,deserving of its predominate reputation,in my humble opinion.",0.0,vortigan,79:

"March 21, 2016",Cohiba  Esplendidos,"  While my previous review wasn't exactly lackluster, I wanted to see how these legendary cigars evolve over time. Here is one with nearly three years on it. 

Night and day difference. The aroma out of the humidor is delicious -- earthy and woodsy with baked goods in the background. 

Appearance and draw are both impeccable, as is to be expected. The interesting thing is how complex it has gotten. I can barely taste the grassy character that dominated the young ones. The flavor is sweet, aromatic, persistent, fruity, creamy, perfumed and yes, a bit herbaceous. But it has smoothed out a great deal.

A missing piece of information. Cohibas for instance are Medium to Full bodied in strength. So for example when I tried a Cohiba Secretos before, or this ESplendidos it was giving me a very dry taste. Too strong for me, and not knowing it. I had read all the good reviews on this site, so naturally looking for that experience like others. Overtime everyone will figure out their non-inhaling nicotine intake capacity.

"December 26, 2008",Partagas  Petit Bouquets,"I just finished one of these nice little figurados with a fine Single Malt Scotch Whisky -- The Balvenie DoubleWood -- for dessert immediately after Christmas Eve dinner last night. The pre-light aromas were characteristically Habano; sweet and fresh, yet aged, though not particularly remarkable, as other Habanos I've had and have, yet, still pleasant and nice to take out of the humidor and smell here and there. I had low expectations because of the last review (#2, by sasha), but I was very pleasantly surprised. Its behavior was exactly as sasha described; I didn't get so much as a wisp of smoke right away, and I was worried that it might've been plugged, but sure enough, after some careful massaging, it opened up. And when it did, beautiful, perfectly pearly smoke started blossoming out. It was spicy right away, the flavor presenting itself with full-bodied power, saturating my palate. The construction was marvelous; the ash held on all the way just until the middle, at which point it fell off without detection. Clearly, this was the Partagas plan for the Petit Bouquet blend. As mentioned earlier, I had a short glass of The Balvenie DoubleWood -- called such because it is first aged six years in an American charred white oak bourbon barrel and then for a final six years in an Oloroso Sherry cask -- in a Christmas tumbler with my Petit Bouquet, served straight at room temperature. The whisky spice from the first cask, the sweet notes from the second, and the overall mellow character which bloomed from the total aging process perfectly matched the cigar. Bouquet is definitely the word; the bouquet of the cigar and the bouquet of the single malt married with such great clarity, power, and, of course, not to mention, zest. Never before have I ever experienced such unity of character in a cigar and a liquor. I took long, savory draws of the cigar, carefully tasted and wafted the smoke on my tongue and palate, and then blew out with satisfaction, to be rewarded with parting notes even in parting ways with it. The smoke wafting around me and the pleasant aroma coming from the cigar all smelled so wonderfully soothing. Then I washed a good sip of the single malt over my palate, the flavors were just so full-bodied, and they married like true lovers right in my mouth, leaving their wonderful spices behind. Just as it got past the first half, it mellowed; a very curious thing, as though it were growing to the soft-nature of the single malt. And indeed, they continued to complement each other and marry. It really didn't seem to me that they were simply compatible or good together; they were truly meant for each other. The farther it went, the more did it mellow, yet the more complex, sweeter and broad the flavors became. I was very surprised that mellowness set in after a very spicy and powerful start, but I was just dumbfounded when the flavors took on the character of its pre-light aromas, yet intensified; magnified: something I had never really gotten out of a cigar before. This brought my thoughts to the little Cigar Shop in Montreal that I got it from. And I meditated calmly of beautiful sandy beaches and swaying palm trees on the shores of Cuba, and the vast tobacco fields that lie on the warm and humid isle so far away from the snow covered one where the Cigar Shop lies. Despite this overall mellowness in palate, it was still no less than medium-bodied. And as sasha indicated, spice was definitely an ever-present aspect of this cigar, which I liked very much; definitely a treat. As I like to do, I inhaled this cigar a couple times to get a feel for other notes I may otherwise have overlooked as they rushed paste my palate as they go in and out again. It was pretty easy going, which also made it suitable for comfortable frenching. The combination of the single malt and the subtle nicotine of this cigar made for a very relaxing, intoxicating experience. I really savored this cigar, taking my time between draws, sipping and savoring my single malt, considerably lengthening the experience, which was most desirable. It was just such a wonderful smoke, such a relaxing time, I just tried to get everything I could out of this cigar; to the nub. It got to the point where I had to pinch it between my thumbs and forefingers of both hands to keep it up. I managed not to burn a finger, and I was willing to burn my lips if I had to to keep smoking it, but wrapper started slipping behind the binder and filler, and it got so short that it stopped drawing altogether! I was just left saying to myself, ""Wow... "" I've never felt so good after a cigar. And saying this to myself and smiling comfortably and sure, I drank the last little bit of my Scotch in one good sip. I'm giving this cigar a nine for the good time it showed me to last night, and for marrying so well with the Scotch that I adore; The Balvenie. I would highly recommend this to anyone who's in for a good show, good spice, and good taste. I'm sure it would go nicely with a relaxed yet intriguing and enticing conversation. It will also go VERY well with any well-aged, spicy liquor, such as a fine Scotch, Brandy, or definitely Spiced Rum, like Havana Club Seven. Definitely the perfect after-dinner cigar if you're too tired to invest much time in a long smoke, or if you just want something easy.

The first puffs had been a nightmare, no draw at all, but when you reach the larger gauge it sets quite well and easy. Of course from this format you can't expect a great evolution and complexity, and you don't have them, but you can detect the typical Partagas spicy flavour throughout the cigar.

"May 23, 2010",Partagas  Churchills de Luxe,"  Managed to get a 5-pack selected from a few boxes when one of the local cigar merchant had a clearance. Cannot remember the exact month but the production year was 2001 on all the boxes. The cigar looked a little dry so they went into the humidor about 3 months ago and today I decided to light one up. Selected the worst possible example out of my 5-pack selection: mottled and crackily wrapper with some specks of green but smooth with a light sheen of oil, also onset of mold. Starts off earthy with all manner of aromatic woods, very smooth and rounded flavours. Flavours build up with more wood and some sweet chocolate developing which becomes more coffeeish as you progress. Earthiness intensifies along with spice levels and the vibrant flavours become mellow. Quite strong in terms of nicotine kick and flavours but overall I found it quite balanced and delicious with a lovely lingering aftertaste of spice and wood. The stick is generously filled which made the draw a little tight. This improves if you gently massage the tip a little which increases the opulence of the smoke. Burns even and long, took me nearly a full hour to get to the final third. I must say that the wrapper is very fine almost wafer thin, attesting to the skill of the torcedor. However, it is obviously too thin to qualify it for long term aging. Around the final third, the wrapper virtually disintegrated and flaked off. Proper smoking technic and full attention will be required if you want to fully enjoy this delicate stick but you will definitely enjoy it. A different expression of Partagas.",4.0,sengjc,22:

"November 15, 2008",Montecristo  Robustos Millenium," I bought my Montes 2000 in 2004 and resisted opening the jar until 2007.  My experience with ELs and other aged cigars has been that time does them good.  I was not disappointed.  This was a cigar that was head and shoulders above most others.  I have been smoking for over 20 years and in the last 10, mostly super premium only.  This was the second best cigar ever (all time) for me.  Better than the Cohiba Piramides EL 2006, better than the Siglo VI (and those were incredibly good), better than the Hoyo Piramides El 2003.  The only cigar that I have found as complex, as full of indescribable mix of flavors, was a Cuban Davidoff in the 80's before they broke off with Cuba.  This cigar assaulted all my senses, smell, taste, touch, sight.  It looked great, felt great, smelled great, and tasted of caramel, vanilla, with hints of leather.  It was good at light up and got better and better through to the nub.  Most cigars are good only in the precious second third, not this one.  This one was the real deal, a 9.7-9.8  I have smoked ten up to now and they are all consistently great.  I don't give it a perfect 10 because I have to leave room for the Monte Sublime EL 2008 that everyone is raving about.  I will be getting those next month when I travel to Spain.  Reviews should be limited to your insight into the cigar, limit argument over fakes, etc.  If it looks bad, smells bad and smokes bad, it's a fake.  All Cuban cigars that I have smoked in the last five years are good to great.  The worst (of the major brands) is merely good.  I recently smoked a San Cristobal Muralla and it blew me away.  Didn't expect much and got a wonderful smoke out of it. The only lousy cigars being made in Cuba today are the machine made short filler cigars such as Guantanamera, the handmade long filler cigars are all good.",0.0,jblanc197,42:

Both cigars were pretty muted on release but the 'C' is now one of my all time favourite cigars.  It seems that most Monte's benefit from a reasonable period of ageing before some of the more secondary complex flavours develop.  I bought a box of these robustos and have decided to stop half way through and not touch them for another year or two.  It's not that any of them have been unpleasant.

"September 11, 2008",Montecristo  Robusto LE 2001," Smoked another one tonight. After the last one being too tight, this one was somewhat ""underfilled"" and was a struggle to keep properly burning.
It started strong, but tasted very mellow and really mature in the first half. In fact, it tasted like an OLD cigar - complex, subtle yet intese - but very ripe. Picked up in spiciness and density in the second half, became more peppery, with the final third being most enjoyable. Oily-coating, matured tobacco.
The main character still was the charred wood component, imparted by the wrapper. Clearly a relative of the Millenium Jarre Robustos, but much more advanced in its development.

Looked like the ash would have stayed sturdy to the ring (approximately 70 before I flicked it). Uneven burn heading into the final third, but by then I didn't care, and I often save the ends for later anyway. In further caveman style, as I put the tidbit back in the tube, a little strand of the caramel type wrapper tip looked good enough to chew. Tasted the same way.

After half the bundle, there were maybe two sticks out of ten that were good to great. No comparison to the '98s again, colour assortment is not well done on the '96s either.

"May 29, 2008",Los Statos de Luxe  Brevas," With still hand-made Brevas bundles available from 1996-2000, these are a good value for a casual smoke.
Two samples from 2000 caught my attention and just tasted great, comparable to matured Quintero Brevas, quite full bodied and a magnificient, straight Cuban profile.
Having smoked through one bundle of each 96 and 98, I would favour the 98s.
96 ones are well constructed, with almost too light draw, but just have an ""ok"" taste. A bit woodsy, nutty, still a bit drying, not very full - ok at their price, but nothing more...
Of the 98s, all were packed tighter, resulting in almost 10 pieces being plugged.
But rewarding for those failures, all smokeable ones were blockbuster, rich, dense, oily textured, just delicious smokes being worth a multiple of their price.
Having to judge, the tobaccos used must have been from different growing regions, with 98s being Vuelta Abajo ones (and 96s Vuelta Arriba or Oriente) - just a guess, but very intriguing.
One characteristic of the packaging is that each bundle is very ""reductive"" and dry when coming. 
A hay-like, black tea leaf smell, but they need weeks in the humidor in order to taste good, as the dry ones will be very agressive, drying and bitter.
The more the bundle gets emptier, the more do the cigars change. They obviously oxidize, take on a new aroma. This can be for the good within the first weeks, but thinking in a period of several months, the change is not for the good any more!",0.0,hercule-poirot,8:

The vitola gran corona is the biggest one in regular production. It can asure a long 2,5 hours at least. Be prepared to smoke this cigar, you really do not want to trow it away because something else require your atention.    The cigar itself have two problems that i have finded as mixing mi own experience and talking with other aficionados; firstly, the size leaves a lot of margin to plugs... it is very sad to find that a Montecristo A is plugged, because is a shame to trow away or to suffer for 2 hours a cigar. The second issue is of course the price. The cigar is very pricy, and with that money you can buy a lot of minutos or robustos, so is up to you to decide if it is worth. Now, taking those 2 points in consideration, the cigar itself is a different animal than any other montecristo cigar; not slightly similar to the n2 or edmundos. The cigar is mild but have a complex and rich flavor profile. The smoke output is always in the tight side, and more silky than creamy. A very elegant cigar that will have a lot of variations during the smoke, but never getting a lot of strenght. Overall, a very good cigar that will keep you  entretained for more than 2 hours, but maybe can be to much to a lot of aficionados.

"December 25, 2014",Montecristo  Eagle,"The double band and gold caught my eye and I decided to try it.  Firstly, the construction.  I was skeptical of it at first because I've had a lot of bad luck with Montecristo wrappers falling apart halfway through the cigar, but no, this stayed together nicely the whole way through.  The ash fell off with each third very nicely and evenly and the burn stayed even the whole way through.  The draw was loose, which is nice since I like looser draws, and the smoke was voluminous but not too thick.
Now for the flavours.  Coffee the whole way through.  Good Caribbean coffee, mind.  Didn't notice much change in the flavour the whole way through other than the strength of the coffee increasing a bit in the middle and a few notes of cinnamon and hazelnut toward the end of the middle last third.
All in all, not bad, but the flavour was a bit disappointing.  As was mentioned by others, this is perfect if you're outdoors and playing golf or something like that.  You just want a tasty smoke while playing a game rather than sitting down in a lounge for two hours picking out flavours.  If you don't plan on being outside, don't get this.  It's not good relaxing indoors with and it's not got much subtlety in the flavour.  If you like coffee a lot or plan on smoking it outside on a walk, a hike, or a game of golf, get this.
Side note: The outdoorsiness of this was proven to me when I had to leave the pub for a bit while smoking this.  It was a lot more enjoyable outside than it was inside, and warmed me up quite a lot in the cold.
I'll give it an 7 rather than a 6 because a good outdoor cigar like this is uncommon and an interesting experience, but if I hadn't stepped outside, I would have rated it 6.",3.5,wraffles,10:

This is my second 50's cabinet from Gerard, as it was not difficult to obtain these back in the days. Turns out it would be my last 50's cabinet of Petit Punch, since they stopped producing cabinets around 2002 and 2003. Very fine tobacco scent when i open the cabinet. The wrapper is claro and silky smooth. After 14+ years of aging, one would expect this cigar to be mellow out by now. Boy, was i wrong about that. When i lit up the Petit Punch, the strength and intensity just picked up with each draw. It begins with pepper and leathery taste. After the first third, i started to noticed some notes of wood and floral scents. This is a truly interesting change for such a small cigar. However, even at this Perlas size, this is not a cigar for novice. If you enjoy strong cigars and don't have enough time for a D4 or a Belicoso Fino, then look no further. Hopefully, the 25's dress box age just as well as the cabinet. IMO, this is a 9.3 cigar. The 7.6 it currently sports does not do this cigar any justice.

This Punch is a fine example: fine, well stretched colorado wrapper, slightly box-pressed. The flavour, when still unlit, is of well aged tobacco, earthy and spicy.
The beginning of the smoke is immediately full, both in strenght and in flavour, mostly woody and leathery; had not been the Punch anilla, I would have said it was a Montecristo.
Going on, the flavour become smoother and rounder while the strenght is still at high levels; no trace of the sweet, honeyish taste of other Punch cigars. In the second third it increases to a greater level of complexity, when strong notes of pepper and cocoa jump in: really amazing, I was expecting a much ""easier"" and straightforward smoke.
The final third show a further increase in flavour and strenght, with more complexity added by a subtle sweetness, sort of a fruity flavour layer.

The bands were discolored and it looked to me as if there had been some kind of ink running. A friend explained to me that with this extreme age, and with these cigars enclosed in cellophane, the oils had risen to the wrapper and discolored the bands. The cellophane was yellowed and things didn't get any prettier when I pulled the cellophane off. This cigar was mottled with dark spots and in some places the wrapper was coming a bit loose. I did my best to gently wet down the loose wrapper and then readied myself to smoke.

I clipped the pointy (not rounded) cap and fired the cigar up. It had a medium draw and it burned straight and true despite the fact that I was outside with a bit of wind.

Previous Punch cigars that I have sampled have been too mild for my taste, but this cigar hit me like a slap in the face with a pleasant surprise right from the start. I got an immediate strong burst of cooking spices and a little bit of pepper, VERY full flavored but with mild-medium strength. The spicy taste was not sweet but was very enjoyable. This intense flavor was augmented by greater strength and tobacco taste during the middle third of the cigar. The spicy peppery taste continued. with a little growth in the pepper, during this middle portion and it reached a medium-strong strength level, but was never bitter. During the final third, the spiciness diminished and the strength increased, and I had a nice, bold, flavorful cigar that I smoked down to the nub.

As I mentioned above, this cigar had a few places where the wrapper was a bit loose. This was noticeable during the final third of this cigar. While I had removed the band carefully, this small trauma to the band caused it to unravel a fair bit during the final portion of the smoke. But this was a minor nuisance, I was able to hold the loose band in place and this cigar burned and tasted like a dream all the way.

In summary, this was a great little cigar that had unexpected flavor and strength for a machine made Punch cigar. This was a very nice cigar that was a real pleasure. And just the aura of smoking a 19 year old cigar that I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg to get added to the fun for me.

It starts with the usual woody tobacco notes but quickly develops into fizzing sweetness, like citrus fruit or sherbert, for a good portion of the first third.  As you move into the middle it starts to taste like tea, which was quite pleasant, before the sweetness makes a return and they both form a very refreshing combination.  Unfortunatly the final third was nothing but harsh, though I got the sense of something lurking behind it so these might have good ageing potential ( surprisingly! ).

A interesting fruity note comes through quite evident and it lingers nicely. It takes some time to get use to the thin gauge, as it's quite a different feel from the other, bigger ones. The draw is also different and it takes some time to adjust to that as well. Once you do however, you find a very nice little cigar, which not that many seems to notice. Well, I like that.

On a recent trans-atlantic cruise, I purchased five different 'brands' of Cuban cigars in Bermuda and Gibraltar and after 5-months in a humidor I have begun to try them with a Punch Coronations Tubos being one of them.

What I have notice most is that it is not the strength of a Cuban cigar but that they have a deeper-richer-bolder longer lasting flavor than a non-Cuban cigar.

This particular Punch Coronation was a medium+ with a consistent woodsy flavor for the full 60 minutes. IMO, the strength and flavor is similar to a Dominican made Montecristo No. 3 or Cohiba Red Dot.

I try to make sure that the cigars are well stored and not dried out. At home I have a small humidor for twelve churchills, which I keep at 72% humidity. 
I particularily like all of the RyJ which come packed in the aluminum tubes with the spanish cedar lining. The cigars come out with such a nice aroma. The Nr.3's are a nice little cigar with a full flavor of the Nr.2's but better for a quick smoke, about 30-45 minutes.

I didn't think much of it as it was just cheap cigar I  purchased on a whim. The cigar had some age to it but I thought it would just be a nice cigar to have casually rather than save it. And that I did, on a cold night I lit the cigar and had it with a rum and coffee. I was immediately hit unmissable notes of spice and pepper. This flavour intensified with some wood notes coming through. It was one of the best cigars I had ever smoked, and I even took it right down to the nub. I couldn't wait to get another one. Sadly I couldn't find any that aged again in the UK. So I bought a few boxer in 2015. I have just finished one of these after leaving them in my humidor for 2 months. Sadly without age these cigars just do not have that flavour profile that I was expecting. It had a few mild hints of leather and wood but not that spice I was craving from my aged no.2.

"April 16, 2009",Romeo y Julieta  Petit Piramides EL 2005,"Reviewer #14, these EL cigars only come with dark maduro wrappers - the photo opposite is the same, it may appear to be a little lighter due to the flash from the photo. If your cigars were indeed the 2005 EL it could only be the most insignificant of lighter shades - but still maduro and relatively dark. Otherwise they were either counterfeit or regular Romeo y Julieta Belicosos and not these ELs. Presuming they were the correct cigars then any subtle variation in wrapper shade has no difference whatsoever on the flavour; even swapping a maduro wrapper itself for a claro wrapper on a large guage (same blend) Havana cigar would have little effect on even the most tuned-in palette. It all varies, with any fine cigar, on subtle variation in the overall blend, age, roll quality and also the smoker's own relativity/subjectivity. Once you get to things such as wrapper shade variation it becomes negligable, save for on very thin-guage cigars. Hope this helps.",4.0,a-dyer,15:

The good: size is excellent for a quick-ish yet unrushed smoke (around 45 minutes or so).  Construction is ok with some prominent veins showing. Draw for me was good, not too tight, not too loose, medium but on the looser end of the scale.

The bad: Very uneven burn which needed to be corrected several times.

The Taste: Initially very nutty, little bit woody with a touch of cedar.  Medium bodied.  Settled down a bit in the 2nd third to a bit more mellow flavour.  Still nutty but creaminess coming through. Final 3rd was ok, went a bit spicier and earthier as expected but still underlying flavours of dark roast nuts came through although no longer as smooth.

The verdict: Ok cigar for the price but really I smoked this cigar and a monte 4 one after another and the class and construction of the monte totally blew this one away.

"August 6, 2008",Romeo y Julieta  Cedros de Luxe No. 3,"I've just smoked my first Cedros de Luxe in an informal atmosphere, so here's an informal review.
After a not too clean cut (the mouthend was slightly dry) I took a few draws. To my relief the draw was perfect, but the taste was quite as I expected: cedar. How could it not be, with the cigar having rested in its cedar sleeve and being an RyJ. I decided not to force it into neutrality and lit it up with the cedar wrapping.
The initial flavour of the smoke was intensely aromaticwith cedar, as it is so often in this brand. Now while this is a classical cigar aroma and can be seen as a plus, I've come to dread it a bit. Cedar tends to be quite dominant, too prominently present on the tip of the tongue. Maybe a side-effect of over-indulgence in Romeo no. 3s. But just as I was about to become judgmental and dismiss it as a slightly souped-up version of that line, after an inch of burn, things picked up. Strength took a step back and tagged over to a welcome fresher taste... that of good Cuban tobacco that doesn't get in its own way.
The rest of the cigar mostly kept progressing in this direction. Good Cuban smoke, thick with flavour and rich in the nose. Surprisingly, it managed to stay on the ""clean"" side nearly all of this time. It flirted with a certain gruffness, the cedar lingering in the background at any moment, but never exploded into bitterness or actual roughness.
The end, after a rather satisfactory duration of smoking, was short and to the point: a woody aroma (this time drier, less sweet and more intricate than the cedar) took over and bid me goodnight as the cigar came to its finish.
This was no extraordinary cigar. But it was very good in what it set out to do. While there may be many similar experiences in the vast Cuban spectrum, and indeed the Romeo no. 3 can provide equal satisfaction when you're lucky to have a particularly neat one at a much lower price, I really can imagine that some people would feel grief if this little stick were to disappear. Particularly because it was simply a very pleasant, unpretencious smoke that exactly because of this could become a polished gem with some aging. My initial suspicions that this was a somewhat unrequired part of the RyJ line-up are washed away. Instead, this cigar is like the little grocery store around the corner that you'd hate to see muscled out by the big warehouses: it may be nothing too special, but perhaps it's just your taste.

Cigar started with great complexity and perfect balance. After little more than one centimeter taste of nuts appeared. This was one of the greatest transformations from light to medium body.

The box is typical of Ramon Allones brand with the name od Specially Selected (the famous robusto of RA) but the size of the box is different longer than a box of robustos. Inside 25 campanas with RA anilla, maybe it is a false for an example other campana cigars with RA anilla or is a sperimental box maybe becouse some years later RA produced a RA Especial de Allones and RA Belicosos. I cannot be sure but taste, flavour, intensity of this cigar is similar to the general characters of RA brand. I affined in Humidor and smoked 15 of this cigars.

"September 10, 2013",Ramon Allones  Especial de Allones,"  Ramon Allones Especial de Allones and the other campana cigar of Ramon Allones named Belicosos, are one strange mistery in my experience. The Especial de Allones is limited, as Cigars Review supposed, in a few thousand of boxes hand made in 2008-2009 for France and Belicosos in a unknown number of boxes for UK, Germany, maybe Belgium in 2011-12. This what I have find on web about a campna shape of Ramon Allones. The mistery is that in 2002 a friend of mine return back from Cuba giving me a box of Ramon Allones with the name Specially Selected but the box have uncommon size for 25 robustos like Specially Selected. When I have open the box I found 25 little piramides of Ramon Allones the cigars are figurados and the size 152 x 52. The box was large more or less than the one of Specially Selected but the other is longer (about 142-145 mm)respect at the normal box of robustos. After ten years I read on your site that there were be limited productions of RA campana, but after 2004. So the production of Ramon de Allonnes campana vitola did not exist in 2002.
I think that the box that I have in my humidor with about 7-8 cigars I smoked the others was or a false for an example 25  Romeo Y Juleta campana (Belicosos) with Ramon Allones anillas or an experimental box of the future cigars of this shape. The fact that the box has the name of Specially Selected and the flavour, taste and intensity very similar to other vitolas of Ramon Allones and different to any campana that I have never somoked.

"August 7, 2010",Ramon Allones  Belicosos,  This stick was one of two cigars I got out of box 453/2000 from the German limited edition (exclusivo alemania). They look absolutely beautiful with a medium dark wrapper and an exquisite cap. Cutting the cigar revealed very tightly rolled tabaco. Lighting up the cigar was a little difficult as it burned unevenly and the first few draws were very hard. Once lit up properly the cigar produced a decent amount of smoke. The first third of the stick was smooth with woody undertones but it lacked the full flavor and complexity I was expecting from it. It was a little bland. The second third came in strong with a very pronounced coffee flavor delivering the same kick that a double espresso first thing in the morning will give you. The last part was rich and peppery creating a tingly sensation on the lips. To me these sticks need to age a whole lot more to develop their full potential. I will bury the second stick deep into my humidor to try it again in a few years. It was not a bad smoke but for me it needs to ripen out more to be enjoyed fully.

"June 18, 2015",Saint Luis Rey  Serie A,"  Just received 3 boxes, all GAT OCT 12, and I must say it is only a matter of time before Habanos S.A. either discontinues these OR raises the price on them so that they are equivalent to all the other Corona Gordas oin their portfolio!  God forbid they actually sell a cigar rolled with high quality tobacco that doesn't either have a second band on it in a blinged out box or super f'in expensive. In my humble opinion, these are consistently better than every other Corona Gorda Habanos produces....stone fruit, orange rind/ginger root, pekoe tea, honey toast, all dancing around a core of quality tangy, cuban tobacco!  You honestly cannot go wrong purchasing a box or 5 of these but honestly it won't hurt my feelings if you don't.  Keep buying the Mag 46's, Epi #1's, Siglo IV's, and Superiores! It leaves more for the rest of us who want an actually superior cigar but dont want to spend $1000+ on a box of GR's in order to get a consistently great cigar! I just hope they don't cut these but I have a very good feeling that they won't make it through the next 3 years as they just don't sell enough of them and it shows when you can still get the 50 cabs of these no problem and 2012 boxcodes are the norm when ordering them.

I was expected much more from a 5 year old cigar, but so far nothing at all. Just bit plain and boring. And then... after few more puffs things started to change. Thinking, ok this starts to be interesting! From that moment (maybe just before the second third) and after, cigar was building flavours more and more. At the end I didnt want to leave it from my hand and I was trying to find a way to smoke even the last leaf from it! Burning was very good.

Many of the usual cuban flavours on show, earth, coffee, cream, spice but with a sharper, more savoury tang. 
Its such a shame that the stick I tried was very tightly rolled and required some effort to get a decent draw. That being said the flavours were wonderful so it deserves a good score.
I have another sitting in my humi that seems a little looser so hopefully might be even better than this one.

"December 31, 2016",San Cristobal de la H.  El Principe,"This one came from a '14 box. Nicely rolled cigar, excellent construction. Cold draw was sweet tobacco and honey. 1st third, right off the bat, caramel and burnt sugar, coupled with spice. 2nd third brought in leather and earth. Last third earth, leather, spices and burnt sugar. A veritable flavor bomb.",4.0,jack0846,117:

"April 23, 2016",San Cristobal de la H.  El Principe,VeryVeryVery good cigar with excellent taste and flavours. Good construction and great draw with lot of smoke. One of the best minuto in the market with a pleasant 50mins smoking experience. Definately recommended.,4.0,jkorbos,115:
"April 9, 2016",San Cristobal de la H.  El Principe,"EML MAY 15 - Smoked entire box - Very, very good as usual. These Minutos just never let you down. El Principe has been reliable for over 15 years--maybe the most reliable Havana cigar during that time. They were smoking great in 01, 05, 10 and 15.  Classic El Principe dark mocha/molasses/sweet syrup. Full of flavor, tremendous construction. Ash held til band on most sticks. 92/93 points. Sometimes you can get some overfilled/plugged sticks but IMO they're OK to blind buy most of the time.",4.0,nsxcigar,114:
"April 27, 2015",San Cristobal de la H.  El Principe,  On my second box in 6 months. Love the flavors-cream and vanilla. Very smooth for a young cigar.Had some burn issues here and there and also had just one plugged while halfway through the box. 8/10,4.0,kimweekim,113:

"August 24, 2010",Sancho Panza  Bachilleres,"  At first glance this stick looks well made, and though the colorado wrapper isn't the finest in the cuban world the construction seems  flawless. The beginning really surprised me, this little boy packs some power indeed! And good although raw earthy flavours, with nice coffee notes. The draw and burning are good, just remember not to wait too long between your puffs. Halfway through the stick this cigar becomes slightly sweeter and some cedar flavour emerges; the earthy base is still well present but you  start to detect a complexity unusual in such small formats. Strenght is always present while burning becomes a little uneven, but nothing to worry about. Towards the end it  can become a little bitter in a pleasant way, adding  some more ""punch"".
All in all a good cigar: not refined or complex like more expensive and classy products of course, but really good for a morning smoke or for beginners.",3.5,sasha,19:
"July 12, 2010",Sancho Panza  Bachilleres,"  A core melody of cedar, leather, salt, earth all the way through; and ligero grassiness tuning in but quickly replaced by the hearty meatiness of an honest man's meal. I was surprised to really enjoy this cigar, it was unexpectedly complex, and it lasted a decent while too as it was packed to the gunnels with tobacco. I would give it an A verging on A+, it did everything that was asked of it; but then trumped that with surprising complexity and evolution of flavour, and smoothness throughout.",4.0,frenchkiwi,18:

I am a certified Hoyo DC Lusi DC Cohiba esplendido, etc smoker and thank God for little pleasures like this one. I don't always have the time for my thoroughbred horses so when i want to win at the Smaller Track i now have the little sancho to go to . Lets face it.

"October 4, 2016",Sancho Panza  Belicosos,"This pyramid is very very good.

"March 19, 2015",Sancho Panza  Belicosos,"  Was gifted to me for my b-day. Very low expectations. This cigar is a very good stick. Toasted nuts, chocolate and a hint of pepper. Very smooth creamy smoke,and a bit of salt left on the lips. Leagues ahead of its little bro Non Plus. This cigars body was a medium body. Med/Full at times. Not overly complex but when the flavor profile is this good, who cares about complexity. Overall great cigar. Box worthy all day long. Easily a 92 point stick. Thanks Heath",4.5,purophene,81:
