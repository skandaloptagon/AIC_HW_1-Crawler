"September 20, 2011",La Gloria Cubana  Tapados,  a smooth and delightful cigar that slowed down my intake on other favourite cigars. How come its discontinued and its available in the market though?,3.5,dernaika,2:
"June 23, 2007",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"Bought one of these at La Casa Del Habano aged for 5 years with a box date of May 2002. First off after I lit it the cigar the wrapper started to peel off. Terrible construction. I tried to not let it bother me so I continued to smoke it anyway. Flavors reminded me of fruits, almost like grapes. Personally I found it way too mild for my tastes. The aftertaste is hard to describe, but I didn't like it. I ended up giving it to a friend after only smoking it for about five mintues. He liked the flavors but found the aftertaste was gross. Bottom line is if you like an extremely mild cigar with fruit like flavors, you'll like it. I felt like it was just one big flavored cigarillo, but maybe that's just me.",0.5,cigar-are-good,7:
"August 28, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"I finally found a box of these gems, from 2000. Lighter body than the Med d line. A light floral bouquet of flavors with a hint of spice towards the end",4.5,habanohal,6:
"January 31, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"A cigar for serious aging, and one which was discontinued in 2001 I believe. Stock up while you can. A smooth taste, similar to the Tainos of ERM, and the same maker, but with a leathery silken finish reminiscent of many Churchills at age 5-10 years. Good to go with an aged brandy. Full of flowery, peppery, vanilla after tones. Construction good, although fans of round rolled bundles will be dissapointed.",4.0,peter-m-tokyo1,5:
"January 30, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"Very nice, very underrated smoke.  While on a trip to Cuba last March I smoked the best of everything the LCDH's had to offer.

"September 7, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,"  Great looking cigar from a box of ten circa 2000.  Been aging for a while so I expected great things. One of the most boring and one dimensional cigars I have smoked in a while.  Aroma and taste of hay, then well...hay, and more hay.  Never developed any flavors or strength, which I find odd.  I'll let my next sit for a day and hope for a better result.",3.5,bucketlist,31:
"December 29, 2014",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,"  LRE DIC9 - A Julieta #2 is a big cigar, thus it must be perfect to keep a connoisseur's attention; and this example does not disappoint. This Partagas-rolled gem portrays the sweeter side of the LGC very well, yet is exceptionally balanced to deliver a lush profile (only 2013 Cohiba Esplendido gives this same feel that can only be described as ""cake."" A modern classic, and the last hurrah for LGC Tainos. Must not be missed.",4.5,mk05,30:

"December 16, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"Very creamy cigar with some spices, cinamon and hints of orange fruit. Complex flavours with evolutions between thirds.

"November 30, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"  2007 La Gloria Cubana Medaille d'Or No. 2. Just checking in to see how these are coming along. The verdict: Good, but not yet great. If I hadn't smoked a couple of boxes of 2002's, I would be impressed by the full bodied complexity. Pepper and spice with a fruity accompaniment. Unfortunately, the former elements overshadowed the latter. It showed too much of it's Partagas 898V heritage. These will take many years to mature into the delightful spicy and aromatic fruit salad that characterizes a vintage LGC. But the makings are all there, in spades.

"January 19, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 3,"  This beautiful, delicate cigar is like sipping honeysuckle from the vine, sweet, floral, and fruity. It has a touch of citrus peel. Must be stored and smoked with humidity low enough to allow a proper burn, and must be sipped gently. I'm finishing my third box of these and will miss them very much when they are gone. Very rare that I would score a cigar at 10 but this deserves it.",5.0,professor-twain,31:

"August 15, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Inmensos,"  The draw was loose at first, but once I got the hang of it and stopped with the overheating problems, it was a serious smoke. Balanced bouquet that is both pleasantly bitter and extremely aromatic. Skins of nuts, flowers, toast, cedar. Aromatic yet masculine. Quite tannic -- needs time. Comparable to Behike, IMO. 

What a difference it makes to the draw storing these smokes at 62%. I gave it four days at 69%, but I'm not sure it made it all the way back up. It is a massive cigar.",4.5,mjmmm,12:
"October 20, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Inmensos,"  The box date confuses me a bit. I thought that these were only made in 2010, and I haven't been able to find anything about later production runs. My guess is that this is part of the Habanos trend to age some cigars in factory and then stamp them again when they ship them out. 

Some of these do have draw issues, so I recommend using a punch, which pretty much eliminates that possibility. 

One of the most intriguingly aromatic cigars I've had the pleasure of smoking. Woodsy, flowery, sweet and spicy. Somewhat potpourri-like. It has a bouquet like a great wine. On the way home in my car, I habitually smelled the lingering aromas on my fingers. 

The burn and ash were perfect. As I stated above, the draw is lovely if you use a punch. 

Overall, an extremely aesthetically pleasing experience. It's not a 10 quite yet, but I believe that it will reach that level some time in the next few years.",4.5,mjmmm,11:

"July 30, 2009",Diplomaticos  Diplomaticos No. 7,"  The wrapper of this more than 20 yo cigar is colorado-colored, very fine, a little bit shiny. The rolling seems to be perfect (and later on I can find a perfect draw).

The smell of decent oak wood and pure tobacco is very pleasant.

So, let's fire up that lil' baby. The first draws reveal a very intensive and strong taste. Wow... I hadn't expected it by a cigar of that age which is also said to be on the light side. Flavors of roasted nuts and coffee, wood, tobacco and leather are present from the very beginning. It starts with a beat of the drum! The combination is very well balanced and the flavors get more intensive and fade away in a very interesting interaction.

The second third is mainly characterized by woody and herbal components... sometimes a aroma of mushrooms joins.....

The last third shows what it really is: tobacco, pure tobacco. And that is the taste... old, pure tobacco... to be honest: that's what I would expect, 'cause in the end it is just a cigar.

The smoke was very thick, creamy... almost fat! The draw was perfect over the whole smoking time of 80 minutes, the burn-off was ruler-straight.

I'm happy that I opened the box. The cigar was a dream, is very tasty and good to smoke. I don't know how it will be in future if would rest still more years. I don't care about it and just enjoy the moment!",4.5,eldondo,2:

"September 1, 2010",Vegueros  Seoane,"  After finishing a cardboard pack of 5 sticks over a period of a few months, I feel that I have come to understand this stick. Despite being touted as a fuller bodied marque, I found this particular stick quite mild in flavour and light in body. Quite a contrast to the No.1 and No. 2. On the tongue, mainly freshly brewed black coffee with aromatic wood and some dryish, cedary notes. But on the nose, very floral, sweet and fragrant, freshly cut grass and incense. Some citrusy nuances creep in towards the final third. One of those sticks that you must enjoy with your mouth and your nose. Ever present spice on the tongue. Surprisingly thick and voluminous smoke for such a small, delicate stick. Deceptively long. Very well made and burns even. More of an aperitif cigar and a good one at that. Now increasingly rare in Australia but will certainly age another pack of 5, maybe 2 packs, for the short term to see what happens.",4.0,sengjc,12:

"August 20, 2009",Vegueros  Seoane,"  After reading the reviews on this site; I thought it worth a try. I had expected a box of 25, not 5 packs of 5. They were smaller than I had expected, slightly oily and soft to touch with and a gentle aromatic tobacco smell. Not quiite my normal smoke- at least they appeared well made - hand made. On lighting, the taste was subtle with surprisingly plenty smoke for the size - a pleasant sweet smell. A most enjoyable easy any time of the day smoke - Had several - each one a simple unpretentious pleasure - any time of the day. Strangely it has grown on me - not normal for me to be affectionate towards a small cigar.",4.0,patrick5,10:
"September 7, 2009",Davidoff  Mille series 5000,"  Smoked one of these from 1985 the other night.  What a wonderful smoke.  Very light at the outset, a sweet and creamy, honey-like taste was delivered.  This maintained throughout in varying strengths, blending with other tastes as they developed.  Sometimes playing the lead role, while at other times taking a back seat, but it never did go away.  By an inch in I was detecting hints of spice such as ciniemon and mustard.  These gave was to notes of oakish hardwoods by 2 inches and rich dried fruit by 3-4 inches.  In the final inch the taste changed again, delivering a nice toasty finish.  A wonderful ending to a simply wonderful cigar.  This was certainly a cigar to remember, but alas, I have but 2 left!  :o(",5.0,knuck42,3:

Yet it was definately not without its merit.  Complex flavor profile that continualy changed.  Denoted honey, cream, hazelnut, light hints of espresso in the finish, even hardwood was present.  As noted, there was somethng of a draw issue.  Despite this it was a very enjoyable cigar due to the complexities offered in taste.

Although the draw, construction and burn were beyond reproach, I found the DP lacked the complex and seductive flavours displayed by the 1990s Montecristo A from my collection we smoked the same evening.

One should not have expectations, and obviously this cigar is already ""aethereal"", almost expired.
The burning wrapper exhibited a very distinct roasted onion/ caramelized garlic smell I have found hallmark of vintage cigars.
Yet it was a very unique experience, the texture being still there, clean and fresh, and that really aethereal mineral (slate)/ faint wine-like bouquet and remains of nuttiness...
Truly subtle and decent, special and hard to appreciate nowadays. 
An experience so very different from younger Havannas with their strong earthiness - in no respect comparable to that.

Compared within its size, this cigar was not too light-bodied at 20 years of age - a 2002 Hoyo Particulare was considerably lighter styled.
The smoke was still quite chewy and full, but a bit drying/ dusty in the beginning as well. Flavours were predominantly chalky, a slight edge of dry oak, wool and roasted nuts, as a friend stated.
It evolved to a more roasted, clay and milk coffee taste in the second third.
Very impressive, but also strangely reminding of Honduras taste profiles - that bittersweet creamyness, that velvet structure... Highly interesting, and clean tasting throughout.

Upon clipping the cap a craftsmans dimple is present, letting you know a professional roller spent time rolling this quality cigar. The cigar is firm with just the right amount of give present when tenderly squeezing between the thumb and index. A perfect draw lends me to believe this will be an exquisite hour and a half. Immediately I'm greater with strong toasted tobacco, light leather, bread, and roasted almonds. The cigar progresses smoothly, leaving a silky and creamy finish.

Pulled it from the \'dor last night for an end of FY party as I needed a gar that would last a good hour or so. On first impression the wrapper felt very toothy and had some large veins (warning sign). Unlit I smelt lots of fresh cut herbs and some wood. She lit easily and the first draw was cool and very easy, reminiscent of the larger R&amp;J vitolas. A little bland at first, she began to open up after about 15mins with some nice white pepper and leathery tones and a half hour in she really warmed up as well. Comments from colleagues on the smoke\'s aroma were positive. After 45 mins I finally understood what a lot of reviewers have said about construction flaws with Upmanns as I hit a plug, lost draw and had to relight. This happened consistently in the last half/third of the stick (4 relights all told) and whilst tolerable in a cheaper smoke, I don\'t expect it in \""better\"" Cubans. Overcame the plugs finally to suck her down to the nub while nursing some Turkey &amp; water. Can\'t really judge on the basis of one experience but I am having reservations about the Monarcas now and will carry a back-up when I do pull it. Apart from the sub-par (at this price range) wrapper and construction issues, this mild smoke suited the cocktail party well - would be a bit light for an after dinner toke though in my opinion.

"April 28, 2015",H. Upmann  Regalias,"  This is probably the best petit corona coming out of Cuba today, no question about it. I can't see paying $150-180 for a box of Upmann or Bolivar ""petit coronas"" when I can pay anywhere from $96-125 for a box of Regalias and get the same quality/texture of tobacco and alot of times get a better blended cigar with a Regalias! I think today, more than ever, the educated buyer/smoker knows that there is little to no difference between all of the petit coronas except for bands/presentation and price. Otherwise you're just as likely to get a great box of petit coronas buying a box of Regalias as you are buying a box of Siglo 2's. Maybe after the cigars have aged 7-8 years or more, the blends will blossom and seperate themselves, distinguish themselves from each other more, but if you plan on smoking the cigars within a year or two, you would be very, very hard pressed to be able to discern between one petit corona and another. The only differences you are going to experience between one brand versus another are the same differences you would see from one box to another of the same brand/vitola. So it boils down to what you're willing to spend and really it makes no sense whatsoever to buy the petit coronas that go for$150+ except for just saying you have those brands Iin your cabinet. The Regalias usually always have a bakers spice/herbal/leatherey/wheat toast and coffee-like aroma and flavor, especially when you retrohale throughout the smoke. The tobacco is usually always of a very good to great quality and has a velvety, leathery texture to it and this all holds true from box to box to box, making it, in my extensive experience with this particular cigar, a very consistently produced cigar in an industry/market of highly inconsistent cigars coming out of Cuba today. You cannot go wrong in purchasing a box of H. Upmann Regalias and if you're the type that subscribes and follows what other ""cigar gurus"" say, MRN claims this is one of the best cigars to age when it comes to the benefit recieved from the additional years accrued on the cigar, but he was also referring to the machine-made version, which I feel was quite a different cigar than to what the Regalias is today. Today, I feel it is even higher quality as far as the blend and texture of the tobaccos used to roll the Regalias, which produces a much better cigar both for current consumption and for delayed gratification.",4.5,tonyaccardo,16:

"March 10, 2006",H. Upmann  Petit Upmann,"This cigar is really a bit of a rough diamond. how anyone can say that this cigar is ""light"" or for beginners is suprising! I would certailny not recommend this stick to a beginner, unless of course you want to put them off cigars for life....may be a good thing though...do them a favour, save them some money and their marriage!! this stick is a scorching powerhouse right from the start...piercing flavour of burnt toast which is also very sour at the same time. The flavours come later on and are primarily dark chocolate moist earthy notes always with that sour afterburn on the middle to tip of the tongue. Its aroma is sort of fruity floral and herbaceous. Meanwhile the strength just gets greater right to the end until actually it does get a bit bucolic and tarry with the enevitable build up of oils in such a strong smoke. as you smoke the heaviness of the smoke crawls slowly down your throat and onto your chest (no I don't inhale). although this probably sounds like I'm giving this stick a bad review I'm not. This is a cigar for lovers of the strength of tobacco and is quite unlike anything else in the Upmann line-up. Its really more about the strenght than the flavour and as such will only appeal to certain palettes. They can sometimes suffer with a tight draw and some boxes are made up of very light insipid coloured wrappers which certainly don't appeal to me so check them first before you buy! This cigar can be enjoyed with a cup of strong sweet proper coffee at breakfast, on a brisk walk in the winter with the dogs, say after lunch, or equally well after a good curry...but never on an empty stomach! it would make an excellent nightcap. word of warning though..because it is so hard hitting on the palatte, any sticks you smoke on the same day subsequent to this one will not taste as you're used to. Finally the ""Corona Junior"" is the same sized cigar, but in a tube, so you pay a bit more for the aluminium! I once smoked one from a tube and it tasted even stronger than what I have described above, so don't know if its a slightly different blend with more ligero in it. what is for sure though is that these sticks could probably take some serious ageing!...""Hold on to your hats!""

It's 6 7/8"" by a 28 ring gauge. I love this size for an afternoon smoke. It was about two hours after lunch. About 90 degrees outside, in the shade, light breeze, and with about 30 RH. 

Before picking it out of the box, I admired the presentation's aromas. Hard to describe the smell. Rich but not sharp in any sence. Balaced, sweet, clean, and floral. 

The smoke was even more divine. The perfect combination of honey, floral and fruit that was balanced over a mild-medium body.

The last 1/3 of the cigar was the tastiest, showing off an essence of walnut.  The sidestream smoke was more pungent, with a spicier aroma.  It was a bit odd smoking a cigar so thin.

It has a twang of fruit or vanilla that remind me of Romeo y Julieta. The silky quality of the cool smoke was seductive.

Although this cigar is more bitter than it is sweet, it delivers an altogether pleasant experience. However, I don't plan to touch one for another few years. They have not quite come together yet. Consistent with what I've read, ERDM could be one of the most age-worthy cigars in the world.

The flavour was excellent for the first third, smooth and aromatic with a medium flavour - indicative of spice and leather. the second third developed the flavour - bringing in a classic pepper and slightly bitter (I say this in a good way) flavour.

"January 25, 2010",Hoyo de Monterrey  Piramides LE 2003,"  First of eight from the local La Casa del Habano here in Melbourne, Australia. These did not come cheaply and apparently it came from the last box available for retail purchase in the Asia-Pacific region. Apologies as I did not get the box information. Anyway, stuck it in the humidor for 3 months. Finally caved in to temptation and got one out today after dinner.

Prelit aroma of earthy hay and milk chocolate. Well made and the wrapper looks darker than usual HDMs. Clipped it to make a small hole as HDMs tend to be light in body and I was hoping for a greater concentration of the smoke.

First third was light with sweet woody tones and a tinge of leather. As it progresses to the second third, there is more leather and toasty flavours creep in, yet the sweet woodiness remains. With the final third, the body steps up a notch. Around the last quarter, the smoke becomes slightly tannic.

Even with the smaller than usual hole, the draw was excellent. The burn is even. Plenty of smoke but it is rather light in body. Excellent flavours and perfumy aroma prevail throughout. Elegant and not overpowering. A cigar for the day rather than for the night in my opinion. One for the golf course or party rather than solitary contemplation.",4.5,sengjc,34:
"June 23, 2016",Hoyo de Monterrey  Petit Robusto,"  might be a better way to pass the late afternoon into evening watch, but I am damned if I can think of it right now. Sweet little smoke with right amount of zing.",4.5,baobab,188:
"May 27, 2016",Hoyo de Monterrey  Petit Robusto,"A beautiful 45 minute smoke.  Mine was well constructed and burned well with a few touch ups required.  The draw was great from the get go.  Sweet and creamy with light cedar and chocolate and vanilla flavours beautifully balanced with earthiness and a soft pepper.  The pepper disappeared after the first third.  Part of a sampler pack from CT so I can't vouch for date but probably quite young: 2014 or 2015.  Mark me down for a box of these lovely, elegant, mild cigars.",4.0,pdpwilliams,187:
"November 24, 2015",Hoyo de Monterrey  Petit Robusto,"My favorite cigar. I smoke one of these every weekend but I think I could smoke 10 per day. It's mild but with strong flavors. It's creamy but not too light. It's a bit bitter but in the goo way, it's like a good dark chocolate. The flavor is very unique. I like also the format (it last 40-45 minutes) because when you finish it, you want another! You are never bored by it, always a pleasure. This is a gastronomic cigar. Try it, you will love it.",5.0,yellowspeed,186:
"June 2, 2015",Hoyo de Monterrey  Petit Robusto,"Two years ago I said I'd be happy if this was the only cigar in the world.Today I come back to these just to express my disappointment because of their almost consistently unacceptable construction for some time now.Draw is so tight that they are almost unsmokable.I store my cigars very well and I know that these are problems of really bad quality control.At some point the myth that these things happen in hand made cigars,has to stop.These things happen only in CC's .
When at last our hard earned money will be respected?No more money from me to HDM no matter how ""good"" they are when you are able to smoke one.The rating is just for construction issues,sorry but enough with these.",0.5,pancig,185:
"May 15, 2015",Hoyo de Monterrey  Petit Robusto,"Very good cigar, it smokes very well with some

"November 24, 2004",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares LE 2001,"Despite some draw problems so common in A-sized cigars, this cigar commands full score since the quality of the tobacco is nothing short of magical.  We are beyond analyzing taste and aroma here.  This cigar is just full of life.",5.0,tang,4:
"July 12, 2004",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares LE 2001,"I smoked one on my wedding day May last year after having waited for them to arrive for two years. It was worth the wait. Smooth, not overpowering, no burning feeling at all. A perfect way to end a perfect day!!
I have 4 left for other special occasions.

"November 18, 2003",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares LE 2001,Beautiful oily reasonably dark finish on the wrapper and overall excellent presentation. The draw was smooth and the flavours sweet and vibrant. The smoke was concentrated and creamy. A truly great cigar.,5.0,dave-chadwick,2:
"December 3, 2016",Hoyo de Monterrey  Palmas Extra,"  For the price point and compared to others in it's size class, these cigars are really terrific. I think they get a few points knocked off because they are mixed filler but does that really matter at $3 a cigar? Flavor profile is classic Cuban Hoyo with a blend of earth, wood and herbs. Medium bodied and great with a cup of coffee. I personally wouldn't smoke after a meal but to each their own. Pick up a box, you won't be disappointed.",4.0,jgarofalo3,29:

"August 1, 2015",Hoyo de Monterrey  Palmas Extra, Why this little gem doesn't get higher reviews I'll never know they are FANTASTIC! So please keep the reviews bad so I can keep buying them cheaper! One of the fly under the radar cigars for sure,0.0,hunter1974,27:
"May 4, 2013",Hoyo de Monterrey  Palmas Extra,  What a nice cigar! I buy only 3 in la casa del habano and I have a beautiful experience. This cigar is hand made(long filer) now!!! and they are now packed in cedar boxes of 25 without cellophane. The cigar are very good looking especially if they are dark. Very neat raper without veins better then on the much more expensive cigars... The taste are very clear Cuban woody which is good in my opinion. Only i have to blame that i have to re-light cigar but i am a slow smoker... In my opinion score is 10 first because of quality and second because of price.,5.0,markicman,26:

"July 17, 2008",Hoyo de Monterrey  Monterrey, I hope to see this come true in more quantity out of all the hoyos this is the discontinued one that looks the coolest LOL. to reviewer #2 Hope it smokes well post a review when you do they are made to be burned and I hope this one burns well and tasts well too! Ill keep my eyes out for this one and if I get one I'll spark that baby and rewiew it right away!,0.0,beatnik,3:

"March 12, 2011",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares,"  Box of 5 arrived today Oct/02. Great construction and nice even burn. Slightly oily wrapper- a flintstone size length. The
aroma on this cigar is ambrosia-floral and exotic wood flavors- medium mild strength. A tightly rolled cigar which likely accounts for the tight draw with little smoke produced which almost spoils the integrity of the whole cigar. If this drew well, it would be a 10+. I will wait to rate this cigar until I have tried several others.",0.0,neuticles,9:
"February 22, 2011",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares,"  i bought a box of five of these coffined ladies at Marina Hemmingway in Havana in 2004 (stamped 2002) and am smoking my second to last tonight, February 21, 2011. During the interim I have kept the in my humidor, smoking one every couple of years to test how they age - and do they ever age well! 7 years after leaving Cuba and their character remains - smooth, still oily wrapper, medium flavour, smooth draw with definite hints of leather, subtle vanilla, slightly sweet, strong coffee flavour! A great find...i'll let you know how the last one tastes in a few years!",5.0,cohibacanuck,8:
"July 11, 2009",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares,"  just got a box.. when i slid back the lid i felt like i was opening king tut's tomb...pretty good stick... super woody, pulled like a champ, not compex at all.  good for a gift or camping.. the monti (A) destroys this smoke",3.5,dukeofnj777,7:
