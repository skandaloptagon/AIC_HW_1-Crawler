"July 30, 2009",Diplomaticos  Diplomaticos No. 7,"  The wrapper of this more than 20 yo cigar is colorado-colored, very fine, a little bit shiny. The rolling seems to be perfect (and later on I can find a perfect draw).

The smell of decent oak wood and pure tobacco is very pleasant.

So, let's fire up that lil' baby. The first draws reveal a very intensive and strong taste. Wow... I hadn't expected it by a cigar of that age which is also said to be on the light side. Flavors of roasted nuts and coffee, wood, tobacco and leather are present from the very beginning. It starts with a beat of the drum! The combination is very well balanced and the flavors get more intensive and fade away in a very interesting interaction.

The second third is mainly characterized by woody and herbal components... sometimes a aroma of mushrooms joins.....

The last third shows what it really is: tobacco, pure tobacco. And that is the taste... old, pure tobacco... to be honest: that's what I would expect, 'cause in the end it is just a cigar.

The smoke was very thick, creamy... almost fat! The draw was perfect over the whole smoking time of 80 minutes, the burn-off was ruler-straight.

I'm happy that I opened the box. The cigar was a dream, is very tasty and good to smoke. I don't know how it will be in future if would rest still more years. I don't care about it and just enjoy the moment!",4.5,eldondo,2:
"September 7, 2009",Dunhill  Mojito,"  Enjoyed one of these the other night at my B&amp;M, paired with lemon flavored club soda.  A very nice little cigar that maintained much of its potency despite its advanced age.  Floral and notes of ginger dominated the first two inches, followed by a heavier taste of dried fruit in the second third.  The final third produced strong tastes of spice such as mustard and some hardwoods as well.  This was a real treat to smoke.  Very well balanced as it delivered its various tastes.  Burned even throughout, and produced copious amounts of smoke.  I only wish I had several more boxes of these at my disposal!",4.5,knuck42,2:

"December 27, 2010",Davidoff  No. 1,  Got three from a cigar auction at Cgarsltd. Tried the first Christmas day. Perfect burn- slightly tight draw. Perfect construction. Very light aroma and taste- primarily traditional Davidoff flavor. Intensified during second half some.

"November 21, 2007",Davidoff  No. 1,"Recently smoked one of these from '81.  The draw was a bit tight which did detract from the overall enjoyment of the cigar.  Yet it was definately not without its merit.  Complex flavor profile that continualy changed.  Denoted honey, cream, hazelnut, light hints of espresso in the finish, even hardwood was present.  As noted, there was somethng of a draw issue.  Despite this it was a very enjoyable cigar due to the complexities offered in taste.  Certainly an expensive cigar, and only the individual smoker can decide whether the experience is worthy of the asking price or not, but whe compard to other cigars of similar age, I believe this one stacks up nicely irrespective of cost.",4.0,knuck42,3:
"September 7, 2009",Davidoff  Mille series 5000,"  Smoked one of these from 1985 the other night.  What a wonderful smoke.  Very light at the outset, a sweet and creamy, honey-like taste was delivered.  This maintained throughout in varying strengths, blending with other tastes as they developed.  Sometimes playing the lead role, while at other times taking a back seat, but it never did go away.  By an inch in I was detecting hints of spice such as ciniemon and mustard.  These gave was to notes of oakish hardwoods by 2 inches and rich dried fruit by 3-4 inches.  In the final inch the taste changed again, delivering a nice toasty finish.  A wonderful ending to a simply wonderful cigar.  This was certainly a cigar to remember, but alas, I have but 2 left!  :o(",5.0,knuck42,3:

"October 8, 2016",H. Upmann  Regalias,"  I just bought my first box, and these are nowhere near the HU Petit Corona's. They are unspectacular and the burn is slow and wet.  They do not have that handmade feel and are sort of Kmart as compared to Brooks Brothers, as so many really good handmade Upmann's are.  Do yourself a favor and pay the little extra for the Petit's if you want to smoke a true, crisp Havana.",3.5,owensinco,17:
"April 28, 2015",H. Upmann  Regalias,"  This is probably the best petit corona coming out of Cuba today, no question about it. I can't see paying $150-180 for a box of Upmann or Bolivar ""petit coronas"" when I can pay anywhere from $96-125 for a box of Regalias and get the same quality/texture of tobacco and alot of times get a better blended cigar with a Regalias! I think today, more than ever, the educated buyer/smoker knows that there is little to no difference between all of the petit coronas except for bands/presentation and price. Otherwise you're just as likely to get a great box of petit coronas buying a box of Regalias as you are buying a box of Siglo 2's. Maybe after the cigars have aged 7-8 years or more, the blends will blossom and seperate themselves, distinguish themselves from each other more, but if you plan on smoking the cigars within a year or two, you would be very, very hard pressed to be able to discern between one petit corona and another. The only differences you are going to experience between one brand versus another are the same differences you would see from one box to another of the same brand/vitola. So it boils down to what you're willing to spend and really it makes no sense whatsoever to buy the petit coronas that go for$150+ except for just saying you have those brands Iin your cabinet. The Regalias usually always have a bakers spice/herbal/leatherey/wheat toast and coffee-like aroma and flavor, especially when you retrohale throughout the smoke. The tobacco is usually always of a very good to great quality and has a velvety, leathery texture to it and this all holds true from box to box to box, making it, in my extensive experience with this particular cigar, a very consistently produced cigar in an industry/market of highly inconsistent cigars coming out of Cuba today. You cannot go wrong in purchasing a box of H. Upmann Regalias and if you're the type that subscribes and follows what other ""cigar gurus"" say, MRN claims this is one of the best cigars to age when it comes to the benefit recieved from the additional years accrued on the cigar, but he was also referring to the machine-made version, which I feel was quite a different cigar than to what the Regalias is today. Today, I feel it is even higher quality as far as the blend and texture of the tobaccos used to roll the Regalias, which produces a much better cigar both for current consumption and for delayed gratification.",4.5,tonyaccardo,16:
"March 8, 2011",H. Upmann  Regalias,"Everyone who is on a quest of finding a good cuban cheapie should consider trying the H.Upmann Regalias. In my opinion this cigar is far superior to the Partagas Mille fleurs which is along with Romeo y Julieta Mille fleurs often mentioned as the top 3 cheap and cheerful cuban cigars. This Upmann features a boxpressed shape with lighter brown oily wrappper that exhibits an  excellent barnyard smell. Flavor base is medium bodied and consists of coffee, herbal, leather, creamy and sweet notes with just a little spice in the first third. I would consider the strenght of this cigar to be a medium. Construction is top notch except the burn seems to be a bit too fast on these cigars. Smoking time was about 1h and 15 minutes. Being previously underwhelmed with cigars that are on the cheaper side I was a little sceptical when buying the Regalia but it turned out to be a very pleasant experience for the price of 5 Euro per piece.",3.5,promajk,14:

"June 18, 2015",Saint Luis Rey  Serie A,"  Just received 3 boxes, all GAT OCT 12, and I must say it is only a matter of time before Habanos S.A. either discontinues these OR raises the price on them so that they are equivalent to all the other Corona Gordas oin their portfolio!  God forbid they actually sell a cigar rolled with high quality tobacco that doesn't either have a second band on it in a blinged out box or super f'in expensive. In my humble opinion, these are consistently better than every other Corona Gorda Habanos produces....stone fruit, orange rind/ginger root, pekoe tea, honey toast, all dancing around a core of quality tangy, cuban tobacco!  You honestly cannot go wrong purchasing a box or 5 of these but honestly it won't hurt my feelings if you don't.  Keep buying the Mag 46's, Epi #1's, Siglo IV's, and Superiores! It leaves more for the rest of us who want an actually superior cigar but dont want to spend $1000+ on a box of GR's in order to get a consistently great cigar!

I was expected much more from a 5 year old cigar, but so far nothing at all. Just bit plain and boring. And then... after few more puffs things started to change. Thinking, ok this starts to be interesting! From that moment (maybe just before the second third) and after, cigar was building flavours more and more.

Since the beginning I have focused on smoking Romeo Y Julieta. I purchase these either from the local tabacconist or via the internet. I try to make sure that the cigars are well stored and not dried out. At home I have a small humidor for twelve churchills, which I keep at 72% humidity. 
I particularily like all of the RyJ which come packed in the aluminum tubes with the spanish cedar lining. The cigars come out with such a nice aroma. The Nr.3's are a nice little cigar with a full flavor of the Nr.2's but better for a quick smoke, about 30-45 minutes.

"November 23, 2015",Romeo y Julieta  Wide Churchills,"This cigar has consistently been a 7-8 for me and were I interested in spending more of my disposable income this would be my regular smoke. When it first came out it was wonderful. I would have given it an 8 and left it at that. Over the past year or so the quality of the build has gone down a bit and I get a less even burn. I smoke hot (fast) and I find that I am regularly burning my fingers on these since I smoke them right to the end and they don't build up a strong bitterness like some other brands.

A lot of folks have commented on the size and that has to be a part of the allure for these cigars for me. I tend to prefer a larger ring on my cigars and this one seems to hit the mark.

These are your staple R&amp;J with their typical flavour profile. If you like R&amp;J, you will like these. If you prefer something spicier, these will never rate above a 7. 

I read some of the other reviews and they mention letting them age. If you have the patience you should give that a try and see how you feel about it.

One thing I can say - open the box before you buy. I always look for a nice, oily shine. Something a little dark. Those ones seem to be the best from my experience with these (I've probably only smoked about 50-60 of these cigars though so some people will likely have a broader experience) I have a box on hand that I will try and age for a year and see what that does - of course, I will have to try one now, for science and all that.",4.0,robdoyle,24:

Great pre-light aroma. The first few puffs were reminiscent of my first dime store cigars -- very pure tobacco taste. Throughout the smoke everything was lightly aromatic, very smooth and refined. Unfortunately the draw was quite tight, and the underwhelming amount of smoke led to an ashy flavor. 

I don't know if this cigar would benefit from more age. I had high hopes for this one, but it didn't hit the mark unfortunately. Of course not a bad cigar, but it doesn't resemble the praise I've seen for it. Hopefully this is just batch variation.",3.0,mjmmm,23:

This flavour intensified with some wood notes coming through. It was one of the best cigars I had ever smoked, and I even took it right down to the nub. I couldn't wait to get another one. Sadly I couldn't find any that aged again in the UK. So I bought a few boxer in 2015. I have just finished one of these after leaving them in my humidor for 2 months.

If your cigars were indeed the 2005 EL it could only be the most insignificant of lighter shades - but still maduro and relatively dark. Otherwise they were either counterfeit or regular Romeo y Julieta Belicosos and not these ELs. Presuming they were the correct cigars then any subtle variation in wrapper shade has no difference whatsoever on the flavour; even swapping a maduro wrapper itself for a claro wrapper on a large guage (same blend) Havana cigar would have little effect on even the most tuned-in palette. It all varies, with any fine cigar, on subtle variation in the overall blend, age, roll quality and also the smoker's own relativity/subjectivity.

"August 6, 2008",Romeo y Julieta  Cedros de Luxe No. 3,"I've just smoked my first Cedros de Luxe in an informal atmosphere, so here's an informal review.
After a not too clean cut (the mouthend was slightly dry) I took a few draws. To my relief the draw was perfect, but the taste was quite as I expected: cedar. How could it not be, with the cigar having rested in its cedar sleeve and being an RyJ. I decided not to force it into neutrality and lit it up with the cedar wrapping.
The initial flavour of the smoke was intensely aromaticwith cedar, as it is so often in this brand. Now while this is a classical cigar aroma and can be seen as a plus, I've come to dread it a bit. Cedar tends to be quite dominant, too prominently present on the tip of the tongue. Maybe a side-effect of over-indulgence in Romeo no. 3s. But just as I was about to become judgmental and dismiss it as a slightly souped-up version of that line, after an inch of burn, things picked up. Strength took a step back and tagged over to a welcome fresher taste... that of good Cuban tobacco that doesn't get in its own way.
The rest of the cigar mostly kept progressing in this direction. Good Cuban smoke, thick with flavour and rich in the nose. Surprisingly, it managed to stay on the ""clean"" side nearly all of this time. It flirted with a certain gruffness, the cedar lingering in the background at any moment, but never exploded into bitterness or actual roughness.
The end, after a rather satisfactory duration of smoking, was short and to the point: a woody aroma (this time drier, less sweet and more intricate than the cedar) took over and bid me goodnight as the cigar came to its finish.
This was no extraordinary cigar. But it was very good in what it set out to do. While there may be many similar experiences in the vast Cuban spectrum, and indeed the Romeo no. 3 can provide equal satisfaction when you're lucky to have a particularly neat one at a much lower price, I really can imagine that some people would feel grief if this little stick were to disappear. Particularly because it was simply a very pleasant, unpretencious smoke that exactly because of this could become a polished gem with some aging. My initial suspicions that this was a somewhat unrequired part of the RyJ line-up are washed away. Instead, this cigar is like the little grocery store around the corner that you'd hate to see muscled out by the big warehouses: it may be nothing too special, but perhaps it's just your taste.

The first half was quite sweet. Caramel notes with sweet fruit balancing well with the spice, almost like smoking a Cameroon wrapper. Flavours intermingle with chocolate and blackpepper. Quite complex and medium-light in body. As the stick progresses, the flavour profile become drier and savoury. Now there is toast, leather and some saltiness reminiscent of a Sancho Panza. The sweet cedar now becomes mellow woodiness. Some intermittent herbal notes and mint, occasional meaty nuaces. Spice levels die down but the smoke becomes increasingly richer, more fuller bodied. Long aftertaste of wood and toasted tobacco. Burns evenly yielding dense white ash. Towards the final quarter, the spice increases. A constantly evolving stick with much complexity.

"November 8, 2010",Romeo y Julieta  Cedros de Luxe No. 2,"  Ok, first up the honesty part - I only bought and sampled 1 stick of this (had it in my humidor for 1 month prior to smoking) so my experience isn't necessarily a reflection of the overall standard of these.

The good: size is excellent for a quick-ish yet unrushed smoke (around 45 minutes or so).  Construction is ok with some prominent veins showing. Draw for me was good, not too tight, not too loose, medium but on the looser end of the scale.

The bad: Very uneven burn which needed to be corrected several times.

The Taste: Initially very nutty, little bit woody with a touch of cedar.  Medium bodied.  Settled down a bit in the 2nd third to a bit more mellow flavour.  Still nutty but creaminess coming through. Final 3rd was ok, went a bit spicier and earthier as expected but still underlying flavours of dark roast nuts came through although no longer as smooth.

The verdict: Ok cigar for the price but really I smoked this cigar and a monte 4 one after another and the class and construction of the monte totally blew this one away.

"November 28, 2015",San Cristobal de la H.  El Morro,"  This cigar is extremely good overall. It is very creamy in a sort of cafe au lait fashion -- or is it Moka? At least it gets there, as it progresses. Think of the very best espresso tempered by really nice and smooth whole milk.  Of course by the last third it gets stronger and perhaps looses a little balance.  Aroma, flavours are all perfect; however complexity and development may be lacking slightly which brings it down a little -- though I just stop at the third third.
The box was already aged even though I recently purchased it.

However, Tabacuba managed to preserve the DNA of La Corona, and the El Moro delivers in spades. This cigar is not loved by many, but those who find something lacking in the Hoyo and Punch Churchills, the El Moro will answer all your questions.

I can barely notice any veins among the filler when I clip the stick. Burns dead even and draws like a dream with just enough resistance to remind you that you are smoking a cigar. With time in the humidor, the flavours have become progressively stronger as with the spice levels. The flavour profile has also changed, becoming slightly drier. My first impressions have changed little and I find it still relatively mild in the flavour department but as before, silky smooth and thick, rich smoke.

A well rolled smoke, god draw all the way through, an even burn and well sized ash before it dropped so indicating a construction that can take the test of time. 
The flavour was excellent for the first third, smooth and aromatic with a medium flavour - indicative of spice and leather. the second third developed the flavour - bringing in a classic pepper and slightly bitter (I say this in a good way) flavour. However, I left the cigar and then returned to it for the final third and the flavour had become over-developed and not as good as the mid point.

"January 25, 2010",Hoyo de Monterrey  Piramides LE 2003,"  First of eight from the local La Casa del Habano here in Melbourne, Australia. These did not come cheaply and apparently it came from the last box available for retail purchase in the Asia-Pacific region. Apologies as I did not get the box information. Anyway, stuck it in the humidor for 3 months. Finally caved in to temptation and got one out today after dinner.

Prelit aroma of earthy hay and milk chocolate. Well made and the wrapper looks darker than usual HDMs. Clipped it to make a small hole as HDMs tend to be light in body and I was hoping for a greater concentration of the smoke.

First third was light with sweet woody tones and a tinge of leather. As it progresses to the second third, there is more leather and toasty flavours creep in, yet the sweet woodiness remains. With the final third, the body steps up a notch. Around the last quarter, the smoke becomes slightly tannic.

Even with the smaller than usual hole, the draw was excellent. The burn is even. Plenty of smoke but it is rather light in body. Excellent flavours and perfumy aroma prevail throughout. Elegant and not overpowering. A cigar for the day rather than for the night in my opinion. One for the golf course or party rather than solitary contemplation.",4.5,sengjc,34:

Construction held together fine, but I had to relight several times, which is odd considering how loose the draw was.  After so many relights, I felt like the flavour was a bit ruined.  Every 3/4 of an inch required a touch up or a relight.
The initial flavour was a nice creamy, sweet coffee.  I had just smoked a Montecristo Open Eagle last week, so I was bit tired of coffee flavours, but it was slightly different, so rather pleasant.  After that, the lighting issues started.  I feel like I burned through this at an odd pace.  The second third was a bit smokey tasting due to how charred the tobacco was at this point.  Imagine coffee and burning wood.  The final third was weak in flavour.
I was really disappointed by this cigar.  Maybe it was a bit too moist, maybe the construction was a bit poorer than I thought, I don't know.  I'm not gonna bother trying again with it.

Pulled it from the \'dor last night for an end of FY party as I needed a gar that would last a good hour or so. On first impression the wrapper felt very toothy and had some large veins (warning sign). Unlit I smelt lots of fresh cut herbs and some wood. She lit easily and the first draw was cool and very easy, reminiscent of the larger R&amp;J vitolas. A little bland at first, she began to open up after about 15mins with some nice white pepper and leathery tones and a half hour in she really warmed up as well. Comments from colleagues on the smoke\'s aroma were positive. After 45 mins I finally understood what a lot of reviewers have said about construction flaws with Upmanns as I hit a plug, lost draw and had to relight. This happened consistently in the last half/third of the stick (4 relights all told) and whilst tolerable in a cheaper smoke, I don\'t expect it in \""better\"" Cubans. Overcame the plugs finally to suck her down to the nub while nursing some Turkey &amp; water. Can\'t really judge on the basis of one experience but I am having reservations about the Monarcas now and will carry a back-up when I do pull it. Apart from the sub-par (at this price range) wrapper and construction issues, this mild smoke suited the cocktail party well - would be a bit light for an after dinner toke though in my opinion.

"August 20, 2011",Hoyo de Monterrey  Le Hoyo du Dauphin,"Smoked a couple of these marvellous panatelas recently courtesy of a friend in the cigar business. An absolute must for anyone appreciating elegant pre-XXI style blends. 

The cigars I smoked had good eight-ten years on them spent in proper humidified conditions.

Impeccable construction and steady well-paced burning. Having said that, it was to a larger extent due to my friend carefully selecting a couple of cigars for me from a good dozen of them. These panatelas have always been known for rather unstable construction quality, which was one of the reasons sighted to me for their discontinuation by Habanos. There is a point of view, however, that with age even tighter-rolled cigars improve in their draw, which allows for the ones normally unsmokable to improve in that respect.

Elegant somewhat spicy taste, which is nicely sustained throughout the entire smoking. A hint of saltiness for the first third of the cigar. The taste soon comes second after the more well-defined and dominating aroma with notes of stronger spiced tea and heated wood.

A medium cigar, it can, however, become instantly bitter with strength if overburned by a hasty after-lunch smoker. Requires a good 40 minutes of careful thoughtful smoking to allow it to give at its own pace.
The last third of the cigar develops a rather unexpected and very enjoyable powerful presence of vanilla sweetness in the aroma, without the taste actually becoming sweet. Leaves a very distinct airy and somewhat minty aftertaste typical for noble old tobacco and one of those old school blends, which are these days rare to find in modern releases of Habanos.

A delightful experience for anyone fond of lower key sophisticated panatelas. Of course, if you are able to get hold of them at all (and especially of the ones, which were stored properly) as they were discontinued in 2003.

The taste of the wrapper especially has a delicious and complex sweetness that is tough to pin down. Later a creamy sandalwood essence and a bit of citrusy furniture polish appear. Extremely persistent flavors that resonate and tingle the taste buds. Intoxicating aromas. Razor sharp burn and easy draw reminiscent of Behike. Come to think of it, this cigar tastes a lot like Behike as well. Luxurious and relaxing. No harshness. Feels like smoking nothing at all. 

I always keep a glass of water and a glass of tawny port nearby when I smoke in case my mouth dries out or I need to cleanse my palate of excessive bitterness. I didn't touch either with this cigar.

No progression from the first third onwards and lost the charm of that first third in the second and final thirds. Greater nicotine bite in the second half which is not my cup of tea.

"August 17, 2008",H. Upmann  Petit H. Upmann,"  For a short smoke this is just an oustanding little cigar, it improves tremendously with age and tolerates extreme abuse.
My wife found a box, 1990 date code, with 18 of the original 25 still in cellophane at the bottom of a carton in my garage. They have travelled from Malaysia to the Philippines and then to California without ever seeing a humidor. Unwrapped them, gave them a month in the humidor, and then shared a couple with my friends yesterday.
Slight sweetness with a stronger nutty overtone, mid strength, smooth draw and perfect burn. Great finish on the palate.

"September 24, 2006",H. Upmann  Petit Upmann,I love this cigar. It is small and punchy. If you want something that looks weedy but surprises you everytime with its character(very tasty with a wonderful aroma)then this chap is the one for you.

"March 10, 2006",H. Upmann  Petit Upmann,"This cigar is really a bit of a rough diamond. how anyone can say that this cigar is ""light"" or for beginners is suprising! I would certailny not recommend this stick to a beginner, unless of course you want to put them off cigars for life....may be a good thing though...do them a favour, save them some money and their marriage!! this stick is a scorching powerhouse right from the start...piercing flavour of burnt toast which is also very sour at the same time. The flavours come later on and are primarily dark chocolate moist earthy notes always with that sour afterburn on the middle to tip of the tongue. Its aroma is sort of fruity floral and herbaceous. Meanwhile the strength just gets greater right to the end until actually it does get a bit bucolic and tarry with the enevitable build up of oils in such a strong smoke. as you smoke the heaviness of the smoke crawls slowly down your throat and onto your chest (no I don't inhale). although this probably sounds like I'm giving this stick a bad review I'm not. This is a cigar for lovers of the strength of tobacco and is quite unlike anything else in the Upmann line-up. Its really more about the strenght than the flavour and as such will only appeal to certain palettes. They can sometimes suffer with a tight draw and some boxes are made up of very light insipid coloured wrappers which certainly don't appeal to me so check them first before you buy! This cigar can be enjoyed with a cup of strong sweet proper coffee at breakfast, on a brisk walk in the winter with the dogs, say after lunch, or equally well after a good curry...but never on an empty stomach! it would make an excellent nightcap. word of warning though..because it is so hard hitting on the palatte, any sticks you smoke on the same day subsequent to this one will not taste as you're used to. Finally the ""Corona Junior"" is the same sized cigar, but in a tube, so you pay a bit more for the aluminium! I once smoked one from a tube and it tasted even stronger than what I have described above, so don't know if its a slightly different blend with more ligero in it. what is for sure though is that these sticks could probably take some serious ageing!...""Hold on to your hats!""

On the tongue, mainly freshly brewed black coffee with aromatic wood and some dryish, cedary notes. But on the nose, very floral, sweet and fragrant, freshly cut grass and incense. Some citrusy nuances creep in towards the final third. One of those sticks that you must enjoy with your mouth and your nose. Ever present spice on the tongue. Surprisingly thick and voluminous smoke for such a small, delicate stick. Deceptively long. Very well made and burns even. More of an aperitif cigar and a good one at that. Now increasingly rare in Australia but will certainly age another pack of 5, maybe 2 packs, for the short term to see what happens.",4.0,sengjc,12:

"August 20, 2009",Vegueros  Seoane,"  After reading the reviews on this site; I thought it worth a try. I had expected a box of 25, not 5 packs of 5. They were smaller than I had expected, slightly oily and soft to touch with and a gentle aromatic tobacco smell. Not quiite my normal smoke- at least they appeared well made - hand made. On lighting, the taste was subtle with surprisingly plenty smoke for the size - a pleasant sweet smell. A most enjoyable easy any time of the day smoke - Had several - each one a simple unpretentious pleasure - any time of the day. Strangely it has grown on me - not normal for me to be affectionate towards a small cigar.",4.0,patrick5,10:

"April 20, 2013",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  Smoked the 4th out of a 99 box. Although these are rolled quite hard they had a perfect draw. Strenght is medium and there is not overly much evolution. There is some sweetness at the beginning which fades into coffee and chocolate. You can taste the fine, aged tobacco and there are some salty hints from time to time. I had 14 year old cigars smoking just like a shadow of their original taste - this one has developed into a rich and remarkable example of cuban craftmanship.",4.0,lost-trailer,17:
"April 14, 2013",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  Very nice small cigar. Full body, but it has lost some flavor since 2000. Nevertheless a very good one. Earthy, wood and cacao throughout. Even construction burn. Anyone who gets a hold of any Vegueros is lucky, as they have discontinued the brand from 2013.

"March 30, 2010",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  Got this as a free sample and probably dates back to 99 since the shop that was selling this has stocks of the 99 vintage and the fine powdery is evidence of its age. Then again, it might very well be dust and mold. In any case it wiped off easily enough without leaving a mark but I digress.
Anyway, it is quite an elegantly made short panatela with a smooth, colorado wrapper. Burns even with a workable draw. Overall flavours are mainly earth and wood with some dark chocolate and coffee. Not much sweetness and about a medium bodied smoke. Burnt nice and even. With some care, it did not overheat. Overall, the smoke was quite good actually. It has its own distinct character that I certainly will not mind sampling again in the future although I wished something can be done about its pricetag.",3.5,sengjc,15:

I picked them up and the vendor told me it was the last box they had and weren't getting anymore in. I don't usually smoke Upmann but I thought what the hell. I was kind of looking for a 20-30 minute smoke anyway. Overall I am very pleased with them. They are quite short but pack a punch. The wrapper has a fantastic hue, kind of marbled. These have tons more flavour than most regular Upmann's. If you can get some, buy them!! You won't be disappointed. Construction has been great and I haven't had a dud...yet.

Most importantly- had an ambrosia aroma and a plethora of rich flavors. The other two, however, were loosely packed and was like sucking on a malt straw. Had a green aroma and bland tobacco flavor- pure disappointment. Seems whenever the draw is loose as a goose with any cigar it will be a disappointment and it holds true with this cigar.

As far is the LONSDALES is concern, i know i got the best one that was picked from a box 2000, 6 years old.

I have to say that the cello did a good job in preserving the stick as the prelit aroma was still very strong. A quite mono-dimensional smoke that comes through as stronger than the usual H. Upmanns of current lines. Not very well made and burnt quite unevenly with underfilled sections. Starts of fine with typical H. Upmann flavours with just a hint more earthiness but the pleasant flavours quickly die down leaving a predominantly tobacco tasting stick.

Could not detect any of the grassiness usually attributable to this brand, in fact, it had a medium strength and a mellow mix of white pepper and some spice in the mouth.

The price for the bunch was 800 US$ and I made all the possible tests that I could imagine in order to verify if they are the authentic ones or not - bands, long filler leaves, smell, color, etc. Still, I am not 100% convinced that they are authentic, they could indeed be of cuban origin, but not from within the factory. Most likely I will never know for sure.)

The cigar was very well constructed and with a perfect burn and medium draw, not to tight and not to easy. Intense throughout, even though the first kick, when lightning up, gave way to a more round and subtle earthly tone of flavors. The ash was light grey and kept hanging on to the cigar for quite some time. Two full hours of smoking this Sublime and the variations on the nose and on the flavor palate where not that great. I missed the creamy Cohiba notes and the evolving spice that I know are some of the characteristics of the brand.

In conclusion, I should say this: This was my first and last purchase from an non-authorised dealer. These Sublimes will remain in my humidor for the years to come, in order to determine if there is any evolution in the aroma and flavor. Even if they are indeed the authentic Sublimes and not just a very good counterfeit, I will always remain with the doubt in my mind.

"January 28, 2015",Cohiba  Panetelas,"  I think the Cohiba Panatela is a misunderstood cigar. The older ones sometimes have what looks like a ""fake"" band--note the picture on this page, the Cohiba stripe cuts through a row of white dots. One of the quirks of Cuban cigar construction. When they are on, they provide a rich reward of sweet honey, vanilla, and mocha, pure Cohiba goodness. But they are delicate and can lose their draw unless smoked under ideal conditions. Dry box or store them a bit dry before smoking. Smoke indoors unless the humidity and wind are low. Puff delicately and don't get the head wet. I find that if I violate any of these rules, I get a bad draw and muted flavors. It's an outstanding cigar with sufficient age and careful smoking.

This cigar, besides its obvious silky smoothness and muted earthy tones, is perhaps a little past its prime.  I don't know about other years or vintages with this cigar but perhaps its lost some of its personality through the decades.  On the other hand, the cigar is still satisfyingly rich and flavorful with notes of cedar and creamy, earthy tobacco.  Also, subtle strokes of exotic spice are occasionally detected, not unlike the no. 1 in this respect.  I also must concur with XXX on the leathery profile to this cigar as well, but once again a little muted and not quite as explosive as it must have been in its prime.

The smoke was still quite chewy and full, but a bit drying/ dusty in the beginning as well. Flavours were predominantly chalky, a slight edge of dry oak, wool and roasted nuts, as a friend stated.
It evolved to a more roasted, clay and milk coffee taste in the second third.
Very impressive, but also strangely reminding of Honduras taste profiles - that bittersweet creamyness, that velvet structure... Highly interesting, and clean tasting throughout.

Night and day difference. The aroma out of the humidor is delicious -- earthy and woodsy with baked goods in the background. 

Appearance and draw are both impeccable, as is to be expected. The interesting thing is how complex it has gotten. I can barely taste the grassy character that dominated the young ones.

The last 1/3 of the cigar was the tastiest, showing off an essence of walnut.  The sidestream smoke was more pungent, with a spicier aroma.  It was a bit odd smoking a cigar so thin.

As many people have already said, it was brutally plugged and I ended up abandoning it long before I usually would. The way the format allows the flavour to develop as the gauge increases is certainly interesting, however this cigar failed to take full advantage of this with pleasant but plain tobacco and wood flavours.
It is worth mentioning that this cigar came from a rather meagre selection of habanos in a small humidor in the hotel bar, so may not be idicative of all of these. However, I have tried other Cuabas from the shop I work in (where i know they are kept well) and have experienced similar problems.",2.0,dreadary,29:

If you'd be willing to part with a couple sticks that would be terrific, but if on the other hand you would prefer to keep the cabinet complete I totally understand.

"November 12, 2016",Cuaba  Salomones,"  I purchased a box of 10 from the LCDH in Berlin. As a quick side note, the Berlin team is absolutely amazing. Wonderful service by them. Box date was Oct. 2014. The construction of these cigars is immaculate. A slight bit of plume, which I love to see and tells me the Berlin team is doing it right. No discoloration at all. Perfect firmness when squeezed and the aromas pre-light are everything you want and more. I was so excited that I snipped a bit more than I usually do, so my draw was a little fuller than I'd normally prefer, but it didn't make a difference. Pre-light draw doesn't smack you in the face and is actually quite pleasant. I love the double figurado construction of these babies, because it forces you to be patient and let everything develop. Since this was my first time smoking them, I wasn't really focusing on the specific flavor profiles, but rather the overall feeling it gave me, like the slight tingling sensation the smoke leaves on the tongue etc. Having previously smoked Divinos from Cuaba, I was expecting the same wonderful flavors and was by no means disappointed. Perhaps with a slightly smaller cut, those flavors will become more evident, but that's for the next time. A definite hour and half to two hour cigar, so don't smoke this if you're in a rush, it's too good to waste. These are just the first of many to come of Salomones that find their ways into my humidor in the future.",5.0,ddavros,87:

Filled with flavor but never harsh even last third. On second box in last 2 yrs and every time I light one am amazed. Have 2014 boxes stashed and will open in 3-4 yrs, at which point they may be better than heaven. I typically buy and hold for 2-4 yrs before opening.

Maybe - probably - I got counterfeited specimens on both occasions that I did spend - and lose - money on these. They were plugged AND shitty tasting. When you throw away about 60 bucks to experience what can be described as extreme frustration (I puff, first and foremost to RELAX, to try and forget about that cruel world full of scammers and their gimmicks to suck you dry...), you just to want to renew that fine feeling.

"July 10, 2016",Cuaba  Exclusivos,"  The first third started with a mainly woody taste with a quite prominent aniseed-like flavour, but with no sweetness, and quite dry, with a fairly short finish. There was also I thought some leather alongside the wood, and some salt on the lips. The flavours were mild but not muted, just 'thin'. The anise was a challenge but the experience was lifted by the salt, but the overall experience was one of refinement. In the second third, and towards the halfway point, the leather took over from the wood and the anise mellowed into a kind of herbal oil which seemed to take away the dryness. This was altogether much more enjoyable, although the flavours were still mild rather than bold. The strength crept up to medium towards the final third, and the wood and leather became more evenly balanced, which is to say the wood increased, as did the anise, but nowhere near the level of the first third, and it was joined by a touch of spice. Some bitterness appeared but a purge helped, until a natural end was reached. All in all a slightly odd cigar, as if the makers had intended something slightly eccentric to challenge the smoker, but did not quite make it. Not a favourite, but not a disaster.",3.0,e-kopec72,49:

"January 1, 2012",Cuaba  Diademas,  Excellent construction- a very impressive looking cigar. Second from box of five- both have been a tad light in flavor and lacking smoke.

"September 27, 2008",Cuaba  Diademas,"  Wow... this is one of the most impressive cigars I've ever beheld. Having had the opportunity to get a few of these from a reliable source... and having left them in my humidor for a few weeks... I decided it was time to try one. It smelled great out of the coffin with that heady cuban smell. It was beautifully constructed with a nice, oily wrapper -- no plugs or soft spots. The draw -- which is my biggest concern whenever I get a legit cubano --  was smooth and easy. First part of the cigar was a little underwhelming... a little light on the smoke and not as flavorful as I had been hoping. As I got into the first third, however, it started getting very nice. A woody-vanilla flavor with that mingled with that creamy carmel smoke that is a relative constant with all the quality habanos I've tasted. As we moved down the stick both the flavors and the smoke intensified. I took it to the nub because it was such a nice smoke. Finished it in about 2.5 hours or so. I agree with OscarC below. Take your time with this one. It's better to smoke it slow. I'd give it an 89 or so on the CA scale.",4.5,mr-shoo,14:
"July 15, 2008",Cuaba  Diademas,"  After one total loss with one stored ""naked"" inside the coffin for too long, I gave a more recent one another try, and it did not fail to convince. Although still a bit hygroscopic, it smoked nicely down to the last inch, even a moderate burn all way through. Already started with a nice sweetness and developed in a nutty profile. First, sweetness and richness of peanuts, then changing more and more to Macadamia/ Cashew style in the second half, where it also showed a definite salty impact. Medium strong+, never boring, tasty.

First third -or so- has a nice but very mild citrus flavor and smoke is not thick as I would have liked,although it becomes thicker after the first half.
Second third is stronger with what I can describe as ""grapefruit bitterness"" very impressive but still too mild for my taste, although stronger than the first third.
Last third, is even stronger but plain tobacco flavor and some bitterness dominate till the end,with some faint leather notes.
Overall,nothing to put me off as I have smoked this to the nub,but nothing really special either to convince me that it is worthy of its high price.I will agree with post #28 and say that I prefer to stay with the glorious-for me- Partagas Serie P No.2 which I consider to be a better cigar,as I believe the Monte No.2 is too.",2.5,pancig,32:

Perfect construction and leathery pre-light aroma.  Burned perfectly with no relights or touch-ups. Complex, peppery, leather tastes and just slightly creamy. Partagas flavor profile, but a bit more refined and medium strength than the 8-9-8, etc.",5.0,cigar-sama,26:
"July 26, 2008",Partagas  Serie D No. 3 LE 2006,"  I smoke one cigar a day. My - almost -everyday smoke is a R&amp;J Romeo N0.2 (white tubes please!). Since they are relatively cheap, I'm not mad when I purchase a bad batch... On Fridays and special occasions, I treat myself with a Montecristo No.1 or a Cohiba, for example. Today I bought a Partagas Serie D EL 2006. My expectations were high, my dopamine level way up and my mouth watering at the sight and pre-lit smell of that gorgeous oily beauty. I thought my taste buds would explode after a few drags of a real Partagas. Alas, my dream of perfection is still not a reality. This stick must have had a construction flaw, because it gave me a hard time. It didn't burn evenly ans was obviously too wet: it died at least 5 times despite my continuous attention. It's not a good thing to suck too hard on a Partagas, because it kills your gums and tongue... Only the last third was great and managed to give me a creamy satisfaction with plenty of smoke and true complexity. Overall, it was an average, overpriced cigar.",2.0,franz-eric,23:
"July 25, 2008",Partagas  Serie D No. 3 LE 2006,I was given one of these last night and what a fantastic smoke it was. To me it was very much like the old style Partagas with a little more strength and flavour. It had strong earthy &amp; peppery flavours for the first half and then seemed to end up with a light sugary sweet note for the second half all the while keeping me very interested for the whole 45 minutes. Will buy a box definetely. Does anyone know if the limited bands come with an embossed or a smooth version like the SD No2 LE. I am aware that reviewer 19(bigyesta) on the SD No2 LE page mentioned that the embossed label was a better quality version for this cigar. I would like to know if this is true for the SD No3 LE also.

From a sampler so no box date, but it's definitely a recent one. 

Overall, I was a bit dissatisfied with this stick. The smoke production was great, but flavor-wise it was pretty bland. More than anything, it just reminded me of a non-Cuban. It had a heavy flabby taste. None of the Partagas spice that I had grown to adore.

Nice puffs and rich smoke. Burning was quite good. Flavour... well, not that great I think. Tobacco, wood and coffee are the flavours that I had mainly had. First third was better than the other 2.

Around midway started to shift towards wooden taste with a hint of sweet chocolate after taste, which I quite enjoyed, but didn't last very long. After maybe 5-6 draws it again shifted back to the earth-like taste with slightly stronger pepper taste. Also started to burn really wonky after the midway point.

Had these in my humidor since there release April 2002 and have been unimpressed with these previously as they were very muted in the flavor department. Now at the 5 year mark these have really developed into something special. Plumes of heavy blue smoke with a wonderful aroma. The flavor is very heay and rich almost meat and mushroom dense complex flavors. I hung in there with these the last few years and I am very glad I did.

Two cigars of this stature should not be smoked back-to-back.  I found the D3 more similar to the D2 than the D4.  Indeed, the cigar was packed a little too tight and as a result the draw wasn't optimum.  I found the first half more light than the second half.  I more thoroughly enjoyed the second half, but again, perhaps my palate hadn't adjusted to this cigar.  I've got a few more of these so I'll look forward to enjoying it under more optimum conditions.  Until then, I'm only giving this an average rating because a good cigar should stand out especially after smoking a milder cigar, as is the case with the Genios.",3.5,cookj1,26:

The cigar had a nice silky feel to the wrapper and oils from it had soaked into and stained, the ringband. I love it when that happens. When I cut it, the end was somewhat firm and the prelight draw was a little tight, but when it was lit it gave off good volumes of smoke(thank God! until the last inch and a half when it just wouldn't stay lit because of the firm pack at the end.

I'm usually a fan of Partagas but this thing almost made me sick. Also it had a very hard draw. Only nice thing I can say about it is that it had a nice aroma which is the Partagas hallmark but that too went away near the second half.,0.5,dusko007,3:
"February 10, 2007",Partagas  Petit Coronas Tubos,"This is where the Partagas Petit Coronas go to die.  I like the whole idea of tubos - the freshness and the portability.  I've had the Upmann tubo and, while it's not the greatest cigar around, it's tasty and convenient.  The Partagas, on the other hand is not.  I gave it two points on appearance - the wrapper is nice and dark with a bit of tooth, veiny but not rustic.  The burn is decent. End of the good things.

  The box date was September '05 and I know it's not well aged, but I've smoked Juan Lopez PC's younger than this and they at least were flavorful.

The cigar is acidic on the tongue like it was sprayed with something.  The first half has an earthiness that is uncomfortable along with a sourness from time to time.  The second half settles down into smokeability but I don't think that if you were given one of these in a blindsmoke, you would even be able to tell that it was Cuban.

There's a chance that aging would help the cigar, but some cigars never get better and I believe this is going to be one of them.

"December 26, 2008",Partagas  Petit Bouquets,"I just finished one of these nice little figurados with a fine Single Malt Scotch Whisky -- The Balvenie DoubleWood -- for dessert immediately after Christmas Eve dinner last night. The pre-light aromas were characteristically Habano; sweet and fresh, yet aged, though not particularly remarkable, as other Habanos I've had and have, yet, still pleasant and nice to take out of the humidor and smell here and there. I had low expectations because of the last review (#2, by sasha), but I was very pleasantly surprised. Its behavior was exactly as sasha described; I didn't get so much as a wisp of smoke right away, and I was worried that it might've been plugged, but sure enough, after some careful massaging, it opened up. And when it did, beautiful, perfectly pearly smoke started blossoming out. It was spicy right away, the flavor presenting itself with full-bodied power, saturating my palate. The construction was marvelous; the ash held on all the way just until the middle, at which point it fell off without detection. Clearly, this was the Partagas plan for the Petit Bouquet blend. As mentioned earlier, I had a short glass of The Balvenie DoubleWood -- called such because it is first aged six years in an American charred white oak bourbon barrel and then for a final six years in an Oloroso Sherry cask -- in a Christmas tumbler with my Petit Bouquet, served straight at room temperature. The whisky spice from the first cask, the sweet notes from the second, and the overall mellow character which bloomed from the total aging process perfectly matched the cigar. Bouquet is definitely the word; the bouquet of the cigar and the bouquet of the single malt married with such great clarity, power, and, of course, not to mention, zest. Never before have I ever experienced such unity of character in a cigar and a liquor. I took long, savory draws of the cigar, carefully tasted and wafted the smoke on my tongue and palate, and then blew out with satisfaction, to be rewarded with parting notes even in parting ways with it. The smoke wafting around me and the pleasant aroma coming from the cigar all smelled so wonderfully soothing. Then I washed a good sip of the single malt over my palate, the flavors were just so full-bodied, and they married like true lovers right in my mouth, leaving their wonderful spices behind. Just as it got past the first half, it mellowed; a very curious thing, as though it were growing to the soft-nature of the single malt. And indeed, they continued to complement each other and marry. It really didn't seem to me that they were simply compatible or good together; they were truly meant for each other. The farther it went, the more did it mellow, yet the more complex, sweeter and broad the flavors became. I was very surprised that mellowness set in after a very spicy and powerful start, but I was just dumbfounded when the flavors took on the character of its pre-light aromas, yet intensified; magnified: something I had never really gotten out of a cigar before. This brought my thoughts to the little Cigar Shop in Montreal that I got it from. And I meditated calmly of beautiful sandy beaches and swaying palm trees on the shores of Cuba, and the vast tobacco fields that lie on the warm and humid isle so far away from the snow covered one where the Cigar Shop lies. Despite this overall mellowness in palate, it was still no less than medium-bodied. And as sasha indicated, spice was definitely an ever-present aspect of this cigar, which I liked very much; definitely a treat. As I like to do, I inhaled this cigar a couple times to get a feel for other notes I may otherwise have overlooked as they rushed paste my palate as they go in and out again. It was pretty easy going, which also made it suitable for comfortable frenching. The combination of the single malt and the subtle nicotine of this cigar made for a very relaxing, intoxicating experience. I really savored this cigar, taking my time between draws, sipping and savoring my single malt, considerably lengthening the experience, which was most desirable. It was just such a wonderful smoke, such a relaxing time, I just tried to get everything I could out of this cigar; to the nub. It got to the point where I had to pinch it between my thumbs and forefingers of both hands to keep it up. I managed not to burn a finger, and I was willing to burn my lips if I had to to keep smoking it, but wrapper started slipping behind the binder and filler, and it got so short that it stopped drawing altogether! I was just left saying to myself, ""Wow... "" I've never felt so good after a cigar. And saying this to myself and smiling comfortably and sure, I drank the last little bit of my Scotch in one good sip. I'm giving this cigar a nine for the good time it showed me to last night, and for marrying so well with the Scotch that I adore; The Balvenie. I would highly recommend this to anyone who's in for a good show, good spice, and good taste. I'm sure it would go nicely with a relaxed yet intriguing and enticing conversation. It will also go VERY well with any well-aged, spicy liquor, such as a fine Scotch, Brandy, or definitely Spiced Rum, like Havana Club Seven. Definitely the perfect after-dinner cigar if you're too tired to invest much time in a long smoke, or if you just want something easy. I WILL happily try this one again; next chance I get, I'm buying a whole box!",4.5,karlos-marxos,3:
"April 18, 2007",Partagas  Petit Bouquets,"Well...I don't know exactly what to say. The smoke has been good, all in all, but I had higher expectations, considered this is a Partagas. The first puffs had been a nightmare, no draw at all, but when you reach the larger gauge it sets quite well and easy. Of course from this format you can't expect a great evolution and complexity, and you don't have them, but you can detect the typical Partagas spicy flavour throughout the cigar. Curiously the strenght decreases towards the end. My conclusion is that this cigar is a great value for its very low price, a bargain if you need something to smoke for half an hour.",3.5,sasha,2:

"November 15, 2008",Montecristo  Robustos Millenium," I bought my Montes 2000 in 2004 and resisted opening the jar until 2007.  My experience with ELs and other aged cigars has been that time does them good.  I was not disappointed.  This was a cigar that was head and shoulders above most others.  I have been smoking for over 20 years and in the last 10, mostly super premium only.  This was the second best cigar ever (all time) for me.  Better than the Cohiba Piramides EL 2006, better than the Siglo VI (and those were incredibly good), better than the Hoyo Piramides El 2003.  The only cigar that I have found as complex, as full of indescribable mix of flavors, was a Cuban Davidoff in the 80's before they broke off with Cuba.  This cigar assaulted all my senses, smell, taste, touch, sight.  It looked great, felt great, smelled great, and tasted of caramel, vanilla, with hints of leather.  It was good at light up and got better and better through to the nub.  Most cigars are good only in the precious second third, not this one.  This one was the real deal, a 9.7-9.8  I have smoked ten up to now and they are all consistently great.  I don't give it a perfect 10 because I have to leave room for the Monte Sublime EL 2008 that everyone is raving about.  I will be getting those next month when I travel to Spain.  Reviews should be limited to your insight into the cigar, limit argument over fakes, etc.  If it looks bad, smells bad and smokes bad, it's a fake.  All Cuban cigars that I have smoked in the last five years are good to great.  The worst (of the major brands) is merely good.  I recently smoked a San Cristobal Muralla and it blew me away.

"April 9, 2015",Montecristo  Regata,"Thanks to various reviews on this informative site, I reconsidered the effects of draw strength and puffed this dark beauty much softer than usual, which resulted in a fine smoke. At 10euro a stick this is a relative good deal in current market. Excellent, even draw throughout with hints of mint. Looked like the ash would have stayed sturdy to the ring (approximately 70 before I flicked it). Uneven burn heading into the final third, but by then I didn't care, and I often save the ends for later anyway. In further caveman style, as I put the tidbit back in the tube, a little strand of the caramel type wrapper tip looked good enough to chew. Tasted the same way.

Both cigars were pretty muted on release but the 'C' is now one of my all time favourite cigars.  It seems that most Monte's benefit from a reasonable period of ageing before some of the more secondary complex flavours develop.  I bought a box of these robustos and have decided to stop half way through and not touch them for another year or two.  It's not that any of them have been unpleasant.

"September 11, 2008",Montecristo  Robusto LE 2001," Smoked another one tonight. After the last one being too tight, this one was somewhat ""underfilled"" and was a struggle to keep properly burning.
It started strong, but tasted very mellow and really mature in the first half. In fact, it tasted like an OLD cigar - complex, subtle yet intese - but very ripe. Picked up in spiciness and density in the second half, became more peppery, with the final third being most enjoyable. Oily-coating, matured tobacco.
The main character still was the charred wood component, imparted by the wrapper. Clearly a relative of the Millenium Jarre Robustos, but much more advanced in its development. That might very well be the difference in packaging affecting the ageing. All in all, a great 1,25 hour smoke!",0.0,hercule-poirot,17:

While definitely young (I'm thinking 6-8 years to go), there was one remarkable draw that really spoke to what this could become.  Just an overwhelmingly rich dark chocolate waft when I had all about given up on the last 3rd.

Flavors are coming along nicely (toast, cocoa, tea, honey, coffee, milk, caramel, vanilla, nuts, leather, cedar).  Cocoa, cedar, leather at play for a majority of the first 2 thirds.

Construction wise I was smoking the black sheep of my 2 boxes (split foot).  Draw was a tad tight.  Opened nicely during the latter half.  Burned cool.  Needed touch ups.

Coffee and cocoa tastes in the first third.  Mild flavour which only approached medium in the final third.  Intriguing cigar and kept going to the final inch and a half.  Really would like to taste this without the tight draw as it had real potential.  Had with a porter and a Leffe Bruine.  Good accompaniment.
