"September 20, 2011",La Gloria Cubana  Tapados,  a smooth and delightful cigar that slowed down my intake on other favourite cigars. How come its discontinued and its available in the market though?,3.5,dernaika,2:
"September 7, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,"  Great looking cigar from a box of ten circa 2000.  Been aging for a while so I expected great things. One of the most boring and one dimensional cigars I have smoked in a while.  Aroma and taste of hay, then well...hay, and more hay.  Never developed any flavors or strength, which I find odd.  I'll let my next sit for a day and hope for a better result.",3.5,bucketlist,31:
"December 29, 2014",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,"  LRE DIC9 - A Julieta #2 is a big cigar, thus it must be perfect to keep a connoisseur's attention; and this example does not disappoint. This Partagas-rolled gem portrays the sweeter side of the LGC very well, yet is exceptionally balanced to deliver a lush profile (only 2013 Cohiba Esplendido gives this same feel that can only be described as ""cake."" A modern classic, and the last hurrah for LGC Tainos. Must not be missed.",4.5,mk05,30:

"September 10, 2013",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,have smoked one that i kept for four years in my humidor and it was sublime.only a little draw problem at the last third.it is one of the smokes which i would want to experience every day...,5.0,kamaz,28:

"June 23, 2007",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"Bought one of these at La Casa Del Habano aged for 5 years with a box date of May 2002. First off after I lit it the cigar the wrapper started to peel off. Terrible construction. I tried to not let it bother me so I continued to smoke it anyway. Flavors reminded me of fruits, almost like grapes. Personally I found it way too mild for my tastes. The aftertaste is hard to describe, but I didn't like it. I ended up giving it to a friend after only smoking it for about five mintues. He liked the flavors but found the aftertaste was gross. Bottom line is if you like an extremely mild cigar with fruit like flavors, you'll like it. I felt like it was just one big flavored cigarillo, but maybe that's just me.",0.5,cigar-are-good,7:
"August 28, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"I finally found a box of these gems, from 2000. Lighter body than the Med d line. A light floral bouquet of flavors with a hint of spice towards the end",4.5,habanohal,6:
"January 31, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"A cigar for serious aging, and one which was discontinued in 2001 I believe. Stock up while you can. A smooth taste, similar to the Tainos of ERM, and the same maker, but with a leathery silken finish reminiscent of many Churchills at age 5-10 years. Good to go with an aged brandy. Full of flowery, peppery, vanilla after tones. Construction good, although fans of round rolled bundles will be dissapointed.",4.0,peter-m-tokyo1,5:
"January 30, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"Very nice, very underrated smoke.  While on a trip to Cuba last March I smoked the best of everything the LCDH's had to offer.

"April 16, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 4,  Just purchased a box from May2014 and have smoked two. Just like the last box I had about 20 years ago - a lot fuller and more complex than expected. Must remind myself to gently sip on these and they are splendid. Excellent draw and great aroma. Loving smaller ring gauge smokes at the moment especially when they draw well. These have some fruit and honey on the palate and an intoxicating aroma in the room.,4.5,ian,38:

"October 11, 2012",La Flor de Cano  Short Robusto,"  Bought a box on the back of a lot of hype, and well worth it!
Great looking, dark smooth wrapper with a wonderful wet barnyard aroma. Smoot and rich with a touch of spice opening. Fairly punchy with a rich tobacco taste which builds. Glad I bought a box! Great as a short(ish) smoke, top draw!",5.0,tomothebuilder,2:
"January 16, 2017",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,  Yes to BonVivant another most splendid favourite of mine discontinued - anyone know why so many disappearing? IMO way too many giant ring size now introduced and not enough Dalias or corona extras around.,5.0,ian,51:
"January 11, 2017",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"  So sad - another La Gloria Cubana discontinued - amazing is not the word, ridiculous is more like it - stick with MAR-MAY 2013 codes and you will not regret it. Anything after that is your own risk. The cigar is simply brilliant - MUR MAY13",5.0,bonvivant,50:
"December 16, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"Very creamy cigar with some spices, cinamon and hints of orange fruit. Complex flavours with evolutions between thirds. Draw imperfect until the end of first third and afterwards great. Light to medium cigar of 90-100 minutes duration. A must !!!",4.5,heinrich,49:
"November 30, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"  2007 La Gloria Cubana Medaille d'Or No. 2. Just checking in to see how these are coming along. The verdict: Good, but not yet great. If I hadn't smoked a couple of boxes of 2002's, I would be impressed by the full bodied complexity. Pepper and spice with a fruity accompaniment. Unfortunately, the former elements overshadowed the latter. It showed too much of it's Partagas 898V heritage. These will take many years to mature into the delightful spicy and aromatic fruit salad that characterizes a vintage LGC. But the makings are all there, in spades.

"July 30, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"  I've been trying to get a box of these for ages as they used to be one of my favourites - finally did - had to spend a little more than I wanted to as my usual supplier doesn't ever seem to have them...arrived today and nearly finished my second. Excellent appearance, construction, draw; to start with not bad but wow these become amazing at the halfway point and continue to become sublime by the end. I am already dreaming about how these will be with a little rest after there journey in the post.",4.5,ian,47:
"January 11, 2017",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 3,  Hard to believe- they are 15 years old and the flavors just start to kick in - 5-15 years down the road people will be dreaming about those. Absolutely amazing experience. Highly recommended,5.0,bonvivant,32:
"January 19, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 3,"  This beautiful, delicate cigar is like sipping honeysuckle from the vine, sweet, floral, and fruity. It has a touch of citrus peel. Must be stored and smoked with humidity low enough to allow a proper burn, and must be sipped gently. I'm finishing my third box of these and will miss them very much when they are gone. Very rare that I would score a cigar at 10 but this deserves it.",5.0,professor-twain,31:
"October 14, 2014",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 3,Last had one in Hong Kong in March 2013....i left the city with two more sticks and i am enjoying one right now in a calm misty NYC fall evening.   I cant believe how smooth this cigar is taste and draw.  Great draw despite the thin shape.  15 years has done wonders but the flavor seems to be mellowing so enjoy it now if you can!!,4.5,shen2389,30:

"March 4, 2011",Diplomaticos  Diplomaticos No. 6,  What a Torpedo!,5.0,ilijat,2:
"July 30, 2009",Diplomaticos  Diplomaticos No. 7,"  The wrapper of this more than 20 yo cigar is colorado-colored, very fine, a little bit shiny. The rolling seems to be perfect (and later on I can find a perfect draw).

The smell of decent oak wood and pure tobacco is very pleasant.

So, let's fire up that lil' baby. The first draws reveal a very intensive and strong taste. Wow... I hadn't expected it by a cigar of that age which is also said to be on the light side. Flavors of roasted nuts and coffee, wood, tobacco and leather are present from the very beginning. It starts with a beat of the drum! The combination is very well balanced and the flavors get more intensive and fade away in a very interesting interaction.

The second third is mainly characterized by woody and herbal components... sometimes a aroma of mushrooms joins.....

The last third shows what it really is: tobacco, pure tobacco. And that is the taste... old, pure tobacco... to be honest: that's what I would expect, 'cause in the end it is just a cigar.

The smoke was very thick, creamy... almost fat! The draw was perfect over the whole smoking time of 80 minutes, the burn-off was ruler-straight.

I'm happy that I opened the box. The cigar was a dream, is very tasty and good to smoke. I don't know how it will be in future if would rest still more years. I don't care about it and just enjoy the moment!",4.5,eldondo,2:
"August 20, 2016",Fonseca  KDT Cadetes,"This is a tricky cigar. Although latter ones were not as good (less flavour and often tight), I tried one after an entire day at the beach and it was among the best cigars of my life (salt, tobacco and cedar) !!!

"November 28, 2012",Fonseca  KDT Cadetes,"  What a pleasant surprise this little cigar is! A wonderful toasty, woody aroma with that typicle earthy Cuban undertone.

"February 15, 2012",Fonseca  KDT Cadetes,"2010 boxes - when on song , is a mild smoke - woody, earthy, savoury, nutty. But often has tight draw problems. Also some samples are flat - just tobacco flavour. So consistency is an issue.",3.0,kalc,39:
"November 24, 2010",Fonseca  KDT Cadetes,"  MAR 2010 box, lovely tobacco with creamy cocoa, cedar and nuts flavour, much like Montecristo no.4 when on song or a milder Secretos. Unfortunately they are overly tightly rolled and half are virtually unsmokeable. When you consider the price, they might still be a bargain even if you have to chuck some away. 9 stars when rolled properly, 0-4 when plugged... how to rate it?",3.0,frenchkiwi,38:
"February 6, 2015",Diplomaticos  Diplomaticos No. 5,"  Beautiful, tasty cigars. Just finishing up my third and final box from this box code. I taste citrus peel and cooking spices. Short and intense. What a shame that these are out of production. Maybe we'll get a half corona. If you can find any of these, buy them.",4.5,professor-twain,27:
"December 27, 2010",Diplomaticos  Diplomaticos No. 5,"  I just finished the last box of this small cigars. And I can say they have an excellent flavor and are surprisingly strong cigars. Stronger than I expected compared to No. 2 (they reminded me
more Bolivar PC). It is not so comlex like No.2, but will provide glorious 30 minutes, which we appreciate good in the current cold weather. Two years of waiting, they will only benefit from this.",4.5,kml,26:
"August 5, 2009",Diplomaticos  Diplomaticos No. 5,"I honestly feel that this cigar is highly underrated. 

Bought some singles, to try out a few different brands, and this took the cake as the best of the batch.  

Smooth draw, rich flavor, excellent burn.  Hints of sweet chocolate, clean refreshing scent. 

All around A for a cheap cigar.  Very resonably priced, almost cheap enough to be  a daily smoke.  9/10",4.5,asb2106,24:

"November 22, 2016",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  The H.upmann No. 2 is a very young cigar. With a box date of early 14 this cigar has great aging potential. With notes of toast, old coffee grounds, and wood this really is a stale cigar. No floral notes or sweetness but with years of age I can very easily see this cigar develop into a lovely and pleasant cigar. But right now, it is far too young and offeres very stale flavors.",3.5,hunterd16,106:
"October 8, 2016",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  These are great cigars depending on the years.  The 2012's are unbelievable, but the later ones sometimes have bad burns.  They are about 10-20 percent cheaper than Monte 2's and this is the reason.  They have typical strong, musty, nutty, and aromatic flavors and look great as they age.  Their aging potential is wonderful, but the uneven burns sometimes sour my overall view when taking the time to age.  It is better to wait on the Monte's IMHO, and smoke the Upmanns because they are really good when they are young.",4.5,owensinco,105:
"September 10, 2015",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  Medium flavored, starts with spice and white pepper. Subtle Upmann sweet woodiness is there but still possesses some predominate tannins from youth.Only slight evolution through the first two thirds, the final third was more complex with that Cuban earthiness and milk coffee coming through. Solid cigars, well constructed and burn well. I have sampled from all three boxes I have of the same factory/date code (UPE AGO13) and all have been amazingly consistent. Still, IMO these cigars will not come into their own without at least another three years age on them.",4.0,oli62,104:
"June 29, 2015",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  Bought duty free a long time ago and religiously stored. Great wrapper, feel, and pre light draw. Woody and honeyed first third and pretty much till the 1st half. From there hay, leather,  and  nuts with occasional cocoa until the end. Impeccable burn and nice white ash that refused to drop. No bitter or harsh flavors ever...a truly excellent cigar with fantastic taste.",4.5,bucketlist,103:
"May 30, 2015",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  I just bought and recieved 25 boxes of LUB Feb 14, yep that's 625 cigars in total, because I believe this is the best quality production of these and want to not only make sure there are plenty around for me in 2025-30 but also find this to be my second favorite vitola in the Upmann line. I'm a very experienced cigar smoker and despite the youth of 14 production,  these are far and away better quality cigars than any other year since probably 1994! I'm sorry for others who wasted their money on previous years because it truly was a waste of money compared to the LUB production in 2014. Glad I don't have to worry about getting this superior boxcode any further. Long ashes fellas!",5.0,tonyaccardo,102:
"August 22, 2015",Vegueros  Mareva,"  Not a great cigar. Not a bad cigar. Just a good cigar I smoke when taking a break fly fishing on the river. Full flavor for its size with notes of citrus, perhaps tangerine. Draws well.",3.5,miskis,12:
"March 11, 2015",Vegueros  Mareva,Most things are good with this cigar.A slight bitterness (mostly pepper) spoils the fun.Price is not bad but there are more classic offerings at similar prices.Surely one that deserves a try.,2.5,pancig,11:
"September 15, 2008",Vegueros  Mareva,Unique cigar. A must try once at least. Reviewer 5 is right about the draw and the uneven burn. Yet typical unusual grassy aromas. Simply unique,3.0,kriss,9:
"May 29, 2008",Vegueros  Mareva,"Very impressed with this Mareva.  It really is good quality.  Nice to look at, firm, burns well, nice aroma.  As described well by others, a unique sweet grassy flavour.  Mild cigar, great for a day smoke and a change of pace.  Also very reasonably priced.",3.5,swan25,8:
"December 2, 2014",Vegueros  Especiales No 1,"  Very good cigar too bad it is hard to find this days. Bought 4 boxes 2 from 2000 and 2 from 2001. Very mild good cigar in the morning with coffee or in the after noon, some nice Pampero Rum or San Tiago de Cuba. Earth notes wood flavor.",3.5,aviation262,31:

"November 29, 2013",Vegueros  Especiales No 1,"  This is a good cigar that was well=made in a difficult-to-roll format that featured an even burn, and more importantly, a good draw with plenty of smoke. Floral flavors and a touch of tangerine accentuated a medium-full-bodied tobacco taste. Not a great deal of complexity but worth the time.",4.5,miskis,29:
"March 31, 2012",Vegueros  Especiales No 1,"  My first Vegueros ever and what a nice suprise. Medium bodied, toasty tobacco flavor with some vanilla bean tones. Very nice.",4.5,bassman,27:
"August 30, 2013",Vegueros  Seoane,"  A well-made, even-burning, good-drawing cigar with the floral notes common to this maker. A wonderful small cigar.",4.5,miskis,13:
"September 1, 2010",Vegueros  Seoane,"  After finishing a cardboard pack of 5 sticks over a period of a few months, I feel that I have come to understand this stick. Despite being touted as a fuller bodied marque, I found this particular stick quite mild in flavour and light in body. Quite a contrast to the No.1 and No. 2. On the tongue, mainly freshly brewed black coffee with aromatic wood and some dryish, cedary notes. But on the nose, very floral, sweet and fragrant, freshly cut grass and incense. Some citrusy nuances creep in towards the final third. One of those sticks that you must enjoy with your mouth and your nose. Ever present spice on the tongue. Surprisingly thick and voluminous smoke for such a small, delicate stick. Deceptively long. Very well made and burns even. More of an aperitif cigar and a good one at that. Now increasingly rare in Australia but will certainly age another pack of 5, maybe 2 packs, for the short term to see what happens.",4.0,sengjc,12:
"October 14, 2009",Vegueros  Seoane,"  Mild, but very good.  I was suprised by the amount of flavor.  Draw and smoke was great.  These are on the reorder list!!!",4.5,bludog,11:
"August 20, 2009",Vegueros  Seoane,"  After reading the reviews on this site; I thought it worth a try. I had expected a box of 25, not 5 packs of 5. They were smaller than I had expected, slightly oily and soft to touch with and a gentle aromatic tobacco smell. Not quiite my normal smoke- at least they appeared well made - hand made. On lighting, the taste was subtle with surprisingly plenty smoke for the size - a pleasant sweet smell. A most enjoyable easy any time of the day smoke - Had several - each one a simple unpretentious pleasure - any time of the day. Strangely it has grown on me - not normal for me to be affectionate towards a small cigar.",4.0,patrick5,10:
"July 29, 2013",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  A well-made medium-bodied cigar with a definite floral flavor along with a taste of citrus, maybe tangerine. Good draw and an even burn. A nice smoke.",4.5,miskis,18:
"April 20, 2013",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  Smoked the 4th out of a 99 box. Although these are rolled quite hard they had a perfect draw. Strenght is medium and there is not overly much evolution. There is some sweetness at the beginning which fades into coffee and chocolate. You can taste the fine, aged tobacco and there are some salty hints from time to time. I had 14 year old cigars smoking just like a shadow of their original taste - this one has developed into a rich and remarkable example of cuban craftmanship.",4.0,lost-trailer,17:
"April 14, 2013",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  Very nice small cigar. Full body, but it has lost some flavor since 2000. Nevertheless a very good one. Earthy, wood and cacao throughout. Even construction burn. Anyone who gets a hold of any Vegueros is lucky, as they have discontinued the brand from 2013. Shame, because this used to be a very nice line coming out directly from Pinar del Rio.",3.5,dimi681,16:
"March 30, 2010",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  Got this as a free sample and probably dates back to 99 since the shop that was selling this has stocks of the 99 vintage and the fine powdery is evidence of its age. Then again, it might very well be dust and mold. In any case it wiped off easily enough without leaving a mark but I digress.
Anyway, it is quite an elegantly made short panatela with a smooth, colorado wrapper. Burns even with a workable draw. Overall flavours are mainly earth and wood with some dark chocolate and coffee. Not much sweetness and about a medium bodied smoke. Burnt nice and even. With some care, it did not overheat. Overall, the smoke was quite good actually. It has its own distinct character that I certainly will not mind sampling again in the future although I wished something can be done about its pricetag.",3.5,sengjc,15:
"June 29, 2009",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  WOW!! SCO 5/2000. This was a very surprising smoke. I burned my fingers smoking this one. The taste was mild-med with earthy,leathery taste. Never had to relight and it burned evenly all 5 5/8 of its lenght.",4.5,lomnhernandez,14:
"September 7, 2009",Dunhill  Mojito,"  Enjoyed one of these the other night at my B&amp;M, paired with lemon flavored club soda.  A very nice little cigar that maintained much of its potency despite its advanced age.  Floral and notes of ginger dominated the first two inches, followed by a heavier taste of dried fruit in the second third.  The final third produced strong tastes of spice such as mustard and some hardwoods as well.  This was a real treat to smoke.  Very well balanced as it delivered its various tastes.  Burned even throughout, and produced copious amounts of smoke.  I only wish I had several more boxes of these at my disposal!",4.5,knuck42,2:

"September 19, 2010",Hoyo de Monterrey  Piramides LE 2003,"  I have had quite a few more since my review #34. Consistently well made, fine wrappers, even the binder can qualify to be wrappers. I can barely notice any veins among the filler when I clip the stick. Burns dead even and draws like a dream with just enough resistance to remind you that you are smoking a cigar. With time in the humidor, the flavours have become progressively stronger as with the spice levels. The flavour profile has also changed, becoming slightly drier. My first impressions have changed little and I find it still relatively mild in the flavour department but as before, silky smooth and thick, rich smoke.

A well rolled smoke, god draw all the way through, an even burn and well sized ash before it dropped so indicating a construction that can take the test of time. 
The flavour was excellent for the first third, smooth and aromatic with a medium flavour - indicative of spice and leather. the second third developed the flavour - bringing in a classic pepper and slightly bitter (I say this in a good way) flavour. However, I left the cigar and then returned to it for the final third and the flavour had become over-developed and not as good as the mid point.

"January 25, 2010",Hoyo de Monterrey  Piramides LE 2003,"  First of eight from the local La Casa del Habano here in Melbourne, Australia. These did not come cheaply and apparently it came from the last box available for retail purchase in the Asia-Pacific region. Apologies as I did not get the box information. Anyway, stuck it in the humidor for 3 months. Finally caved in to temptation and got one out today after dinner.

Prelit aroma of earthy hay and milk chocolate. Well made and the wrapper looks darker than usual HDMs. Clipped it to make a small hole as HDMs tend to be light in body and I was hoping for a greater concentration of the smoke.

First third was light with sweet woody tones and a tinge of leather. As it progresses to the second third, there is more leather and toasty flavours creep in, yet the sweet woodiness remains. With the final third, the body steps up a notch. Around the last quarter, the smoke becomes slightly tannic.

Even with the smaller than usual hole, the draw was excellent. The burn is even. Plenty of smoke but it is rather light in body. Excellent flavours and perfumy aroma prevail throughout. Elegant and not overpowering. A cigar for the day rather than for the night in my opinion. One for the golf course or party rather than solitary contemplation.",4.5,sengjc,34:

"August 20, 2011",Hoyo de Monterrey  Le Hoyo du Dauphin,"Smoked a couple of these marvellous panatelas recently courtesy of a friend in the cigar business. An absolute must for anyone appreciating elegant pre-XXI style blends. 

The cigars I smoked had good eight-ten years on them spent in proper humidified conditions.

Impeccable construction and steady well-paced burning. Having said that, it was to a larger extent due to my friend carefully selecting a couple of cigars for me from a good dozen of them. These panatelas have always been known for rather unstable construction quality, which was one of the reasons sighted to me for their discontinuation by Habanos. There is a point of view, however, that with age even tighter-rolled cigars improve in their draw, which allows for the ones normally unsmokable to improve in that respect.

Elegant somewhat spicy taste, which is nicely sustained throughout the entire smoking. A hint of saltiness for the first third of the cigar. The taste soon comes second after the more well-defined and dominating aroma with notes of stronger spiced tea and heated wood.

A medium cigar, it can, however, become instantly bitter with strength if overburned by a hasty after-lunch smoker. Requires a good 40 minutes of careful thoughtful smoking to allow it to give at its own pace.
The last third of the cigar develops a rather unexpected and very enjoyable powerful presence of vanilla sweetness in the aroma, without the taste actually becoming sweet. Leaves a very distinct airy and somewhat minty aftertaste typical for noble old tobacco and one of those old school blends, which are these days rare to find in modern releases of Habanos.

A delightful experience for anyone fond of lower key sophisticated panatelas. Of course, if you are able to get hold of them at all (and especially of the ones, which were stored properly) as they were discontinued in 2003.

With almost seven years of age, these flavors resemble those of an aged Le Hoyo stick: strong and woody with great complexity. The burn is even and slow, leaving a long crisp silver-gray ash. Overall, a very satisfying and tasty evening smoke, my third cigar of the day. I believe these will continue to improve with age, so no hurry to smoke these up.",4.5,cpubiz,13:

It's all very complex and tough to pin down -- like walking into a small shop that sells all those things and just taking a big whiff. The taste of the wrapper especially has a delicious and complex sweetness that is tough to pin down. Later a creamy sandalwood essence and a bit of citrusy furniture polish appear. Extremely persistent flavors that resonate and tingle the taste buds. Intoxicating aromas. Razor sharp burn and easy draw reminiscent of Behike. Come to think of it, this cigar tastes a lot like Behike as well. Luxurious and relaxing. No harshness. Feels like smoking nothing at all. 

I always keep a glass of water and a glass of tawny port nearby when I smoke in case my mouth dries out or I need to cleanse my palate of excessive bitterness. I didn't touch either with this cigar. It was never drying and never overpowering. It carries with it enormous complexity and harmony that triggers nostalgia for a place that doesn't exist -- a dreamland if you will.

"February 11, 2017",Hoyo de Monterrey  Epicure No. 2,"  Bought as a single from Havana Express in Sydney.  Good looking stick.  Good construction, nice tobacco smell.  Lit it up and was immediately struck by the creamy coffee flavours and thought immediately that this was going to be one of my favourites.  Tight draw though.  Not insurmountable but need a couple of pulls to generate reasonable smoke.  Coffee flavours fell off pretty quickly though.  Started as mild to medium but went to medium and then on the fullish side for the final third.  No progression from the first third onwards and lost the charm of that first third in the second and final thirds. Greater nicotine bite in the second half which is not my cup of tea. Maybe a bit too young.  Would like to try a more aged sample though to see if those creamy coffee flavours kick through.

I also found the draw a little difficult from about half-way, and constantly needing to draw multiple times to keep it lit, whereas the first half was just perfect.

Flavours are rather mild (as you'd expect from a mild cigar), but what made this particular one special were these tantalising flavours of milk chocolate and honey. Lots of grass/tobacco flavours, very little spice (I like them without spice).

I did get a little bored with it by the last third. The flavour representation is rather limited and doesn't really progress much other than getting a little spicier towards the end.

On first impression the wrapper felt very toothy and had some large veins (warning sign). Unlit I smelt lots of fresh cut herbs and some wood. She lit easily and the first draw was cool and very easy, reminiscent of the larger R&amp;J vitolas. A little bland at first, she began to open up after about 15mins with some nice white pepper and leathery tones and a half hour in she really warmed up as well. Comments from colleagues on the smoke\'s aroma were positive. After 45 mins I finally understood what a lot of reviewers have said about construction flaws with Upmanns as I hit a plug, lost draw and had to relight. This happened consistently in the last half/third of the stick (4 relights all told) and whilst tolerable in a cheaper smoke, I don\'t expect it in \""better\"" Cubans. Overcame the plugs finally to suck her down to the nub while nursing some Turkey &amp; water. Can\'t really judge on the basis of one experience but I am having reservations about the Monarcas now and will carry a back-up when I do pull it. Apart from the sub-par (at this price range) wrapper and construction issues, this mild smoke suited the cocktail party well - would be a bit light for an after dinner toke though in my opinion.

The aroma is subtle but rich. Not harsh on the mouth, no after taste and the draw is heavenly. My only disappointment was it was over too soon but look forward to the next one.",4.0,cupshaw,2:
"April 7, 2016",H. Upmann  Royal Robustos,"Probably one of the best value for price cigars that Habanos has released over the years.  The cigar us exceptional and although my last visit of these cigars showed that they are a bit sick, I am not worried in the least.  Freshly smoked, they are excellent, with typical H Upmann flavours growing from medium to medium-full by the end.  Definitely a cigar to hold and age.",4.5,cookj1,20:
"February 10, 2016",H. Upmann  Royal Robustos,  Very good cigar now. Benn holding them for three years and they are coming into their own. Straight forward tobacco with and plenty of creamy smoke. Better than the Conni A I have but those are still very fresh.,4.5,joeypots,19:
"November 6, 2015",H. Upmann  Royal Robustos,"  Could not resist going back to this cigar. Although still tasted young, there were hints of cinnamon and licorice during the first and second third. Maybe it's because of the green tea I was pairing it with. The pure tobacco flavor comes on strong in the last third. The construction is excellent, as the draw was effortless. This is a 9.2 for now, but it will definitely improve with age.",4.5,x-man,18:
"July 5, 2015",H. Upmann  Royal Robustos,  UPE Nov 12. Fantastic stick. LCDH releases have been spot on. These are Great rott surprisingly and will yield even better results down the line. Got 3 boxes and sampled 1 out of each and all are terrific. They just released another 5000 boxes.,5.0,phil-mckrackin,17:
"April 8, 2015",H. Upmann  Royal Robustos,"Smoked immediately from the store's humidor. Puffed well for approximately 20 minutes with a large Alt (Dusseldorf) beer. Any initial issues with burn probably due to my faulty lighting, but evened out pretty quickly. Agree with previous cedar assessments, but didn't catch the creaminess. Enjoyed second half more than the first. By my limited experience, this was a strong, woody cigar. Not used to a tobacco buzz, this baby gave me a good one that kept me dizzy a minute. With very similar pricing throughout W. Europe (except hotels), and at 11.00e a stick, these are the best bargain I've found.",4.0,stogiemeister,16:
"November 2, 2007",H. Upmann  Preciosas,"I was given five of these (also from 1992). Some cigars grow in strength with age, with 15 years on them, these demi-tasse have some power without the harshness of young tobacco - the leathery, earthy, slightly bitter flavours of Upmann will hit you hard. If you like a very full-bodied Upmann then these are for you - be warned though, even such a small vitola will need to be washed down with a strong drink. As I prefer cigars with some subtlety and sweetness, and can now say with some certainty that I am no fan of the Upmann brand flavour profile, I will avoid them in the future.",3.0,frenchkiwi,3:
"April 12, 2007",H. Upmann  Preciosas,"I was gifted one of these from 1992.  What an amazing little smoke.  25 minutes of pure tobacco goodness.  Excellent construction and great draw.  Some ever so slight earthy, herbal tones throughout.  Definitely worth seeking these out.",4.5,legendsoftheplayground,2:
"November 5, 2007",H. Upmann  Naturales,"An exceptional cigar!  So sad these were discontinued as their flavors gain an exquisite depth with proper age and storage.  So happy I have a box of these left.  If you can find any, buy them immediately.",4.5,xxx,2:
