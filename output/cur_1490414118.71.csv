Amazing cigar from the early nineties a classicMM with a twist - strong, full body and obnoxious in a good way - one does not get/taste cigars like that these days, but if one never tried that one - it is a shame. Discontinued in 1999.

Deep Rich and very earthy flavors. Very complex flavors that change throughout. I dont think you could want more in a cigar. I rate these far above the cuban Dunhills and Davidoffs that I have had(i.e, Davi #1,2 and Dunhill Cabinetta and Mojito) that IMHO are past their prime at this stage.

I will put these in a humi with low humidity and work its way up to (maybe) restoring these cigars.  I think a year should do the trick, but I will see.  I really don't know what to expect when they become smokeable.  Right now, they have very little odor, and they wrappers are wrinkly.

"July 2, 2005",H. Upmann  Royal Coronas,"My first Upmann, I bought this loose along with a Monarcas about 2 months ago from Alexander\'s in Melbourne. Pulled it from the \'dor last night for an end of FY party as I needed a gar that would last a good hour or so. On first impression the wrapper felt very toothy and had some large veins (warning sign). Unlit I smelt lots of fresh cut herbs and some wood. She lit easily and the first draw was cool and very easy, reminiscent of the larger R&amp;J vitolas. A little bland at first, she began to open up after about 15mins with some nice white pepper and leathery tones and a half hour in she really warmed up as well. Comments from colleagues on the smoke\'s aroma were positive. After 45 mins I finally understood what a lot of reviewers have said about construction flaws with Upmanns as I hit a plug, lost draw and had to relight. This happened consistently in the last half/third of the stick (4 relights all told) and whilst tolerable in a cheaper smoke, I don\'t expect it in \""better\"" Cubans. Overcame the plugs finally to suck her down to the nub while nursing some Turkey &amp; water. Can\'t really judge on the basis of one experience but I am having reservations about the Monarcas now and will carry a back-up when I do pull it. Apart from the sub-par (at this price range) wrapper and construction issues, this mild smoke suited the cocktail party well - would be a bit light for an after dinner toke though in my opinion.

Some cigars grow in strength with age, with 15 years on them, these demi-tasse have some power without the harshness of young tobacco - the leathery, earthy, slightly bitter flavours of Upmann will hit you hard. If you like a very full-bodied Upmann then these are for you - be warned though, even such a small vitola will need to be washed down with a strong drink.

"February 10, 2007",Partagas  Petit Coronas Tubos,"This is where the Partagas Petit Coronas go to die.  I like the whole idea of tubos - the freshness and the portability.  I've had the Upmann tubo and, while it's not the greatest cigar around, it's tasty and convenient.  The Partagas, on the other hand is not.  I gave it two points on appearance - the wrapper is nice and dark with a bit of tooth, veiny but not rustic.  The burn is decent. End of the good things.

  The box date was September '05 and I know it's not well aged, but I've smoked Juan Lopez PC's younger than this and they at least were flavorful.

The cigar is acidic on the tongue like it was sprayed with something.  The first half has an earthiness that is uncomfortable along with a sourness from time to time.  The second half settles down into smokeability but I don't think that if you were given one of these in a blindsmoke, you would even be able to tell that it was Cuban.

There's a chance that aging would help the cigar, but some cigars never get better and I believe this is going to be one of them.
