"September 20, 2011",La Gloria Cubana  Tapados,  a smooth and delightful cigar that slowed down my intake on other favourite cigars. How come its discontinued and its available in the market though?,3.5,dernaika,2:
"August 26, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 4,"A gourgeous cigar - lots of cocoa powder flavours and, I would almost bet, some slight vanilla. Rich and complex, this cigar offers a high quality 50 min smoke. Perfect draw.",4.5,heinrich,40:
"May 13, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 4,"The best smoke I ever had. Fruits and flowers all along the smoke, on a woody and honey base, medium in strenght, the perfect size, not too long in time but not too short, this was absolutely perfect from start to finish, with an excellent price! 9/10",4.5,petit-nyctale,39:
"April 16, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 4,  Just purchased a box from May2014 and have smoked two. Just like the last box I had about 20 years ago - a lot fuller and more complex than expected. Must remind myself to gently sip on these and they are splendid. Excellent draw and great aroma. Loving smaller ring gauge smokes at the moment especially when they draw well. These have some fruit and honey on the palate and an intoxicating aroma in the room.,4.5,ian,38:
"November 18, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 4,"  Excellent cigar with loads of deep, rich tobacco flavor with floral overtones.. Even burning. Fine Draw. Lots of smoke. One of my favorites",5.0,miskis,37:
"November 3, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 4," Box code ULA ABR 2015.I bought a few boxes, they smell well.I smoked one piece. They are young now, but not bland. Surprisingly moderate to strong with a growing taste.They remind me more young SLR or RASS, strong coffee beens taste. We'll see in a few years. it pays to wait 4-5 years.",0.0,kml,36:
"January 11, 2017",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 3,  Hard to believe- they are 15 years old and the flavors just start to kick in - 5-15 years down the road people will be dreaming about those. Absolutely amazing experience. Highly recommended,5.0,bonvivant,32:
"January 19, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 3,"  This beautiful, delicate cigar is like sipping honeysuckle from the vine, sweet, floral, and fruity. It has a touch of citrus peel. Must be stored and smoked with humidity low enough to allow a proper burn, and must be sipped gently. I'm finishing my third box of these and will miss them very much when they are gone. Very rare that I would score a cigar at 10 but this deserves it.",5.0,professor-twain,31:
"October 14, 2014",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 3,Last had one in Hong Kong in March 2013....i left the city with two more sticks and i am enjoying one right now in a calm misty NYC fall evening.   I cant believe how smooth this cigar is taste and draw.  Great draw despite the thin shape.  15 years has done wonders but the flavor seems to be mellowing so enjoy it now if you can!!,4.5,shen2389,30:
"October 20, 2013",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 3,"  After a 2007 Punch Churchill the LGC No.3 is the ideal ""second cigar"" giving a full spicy complex cuban classic taste. Happy to have a number of 2002 boxes waiting...",5.0,purissimo,29:
"July 30, 2013",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 3,"  sigaro veramente speciale, ho trovato un box da 25 meraviglioso, conservato in modo superbo da tabaccai veramente professionali e appassionati, lo sto fumando ora, sono al segundo tercio, bevo un ottimo metodo classico freschissimo, il fruttato del sigaro e i suoi profumi floreali si fondono perfettamente con il bouquet di questo vino ben fatto...sono momenti da ricordare",0.0,goethe66,28:
"September 7, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,"  Great looking cigar from a box of ten circa 2000.  Been aging for a while so I expected great things. One of the most boring and one dimensional cigars I have smoked in a while.  Aroma and taste of hay, then well...hay, and more hay.  Never developed any flavors or strength, which I find odd.  I'll let my next sit for a day and hope for a better result.",3.5,bucketlist,31:
"December 29, 2014",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,"  LRE DIC9 - A Julieta #2 is a big cigar, thus it must be perfect to keep a connoisseur's attention; and this example does not disappoint. This Partagas-rolled gem portrays the sweeter side of the LGC very well, yet is exceptionally balanced to deliver a lush profile (only 2013 Cohiba Esplendido gives this same feel that can only be described as ""cake."" A modern classic, and the last hurrah for LGC Tainos. Must not be missed.",4.5,mk05,30:
"November 11, 2013",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,"  Every time I smoke these, there is a sense of meeting an old friend and a reminder that I need more Tainos. Fruit on earth base mixed with nostalgia. A classic!",5.0,bonvivant,29:
"September 10, 2013",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,have smoked one that i kept for four years in my humidor and it was sublime.only a little draw problem at the last third.it is one of the smokes which i would want to experience every day...,5.0,kamaz,28:

"June 23, 2007",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"Bought one of these at La Casa Del Habano aged for 5 years with a box date of May 2002. First off after I lit it the cigar the wrapper started to peel off. Terrible construction. I tried to not let it bother me so I continued to smoke it anyway. Flavors reminded me of fruits, almost like grapes. Personally I found it way too mild for my tastes. The aftertaste is hard to describe, but I didn't like it. I ended up giving it to a friend after only smoking it for about five mintues. He liked the flavors but found the aftertaste was gross. Bottom line is if you like an extremely mild cigar with fruit like flavors, you'll like it. I felt like it was just one big flavored cigarillo, but maybe that's just me.",0.5,cigar-are-good,7:
"August 28, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"I finally found a box of these gems, from 2000. Lighter body than the Med d line. A light floral bouquet of flavors with a hint of spice towards the end",4.5,habanohal,6:
"January 31, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"A cigar for serious aging, and one which was discontinued in 2001 I believe. Stock up while you can. A smooth taste, similar to the Tainos of ERM, and the same maker, but with a leathery silken finish reminiscent of many Churchills at age 5-10 years. Good to go with an aged brandy. Full of flowery, peppery, vanilla after tones. Construction good, although fans of round rolled bundles will be dissapointed.",4.0,peter-m-tokyo1,5:
"January 30, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"Very nice, very underrated smoke.  While on a trip to Cuba last March I smoked the best of everything the LCDH's had to offer. This cigar was one of the better that I had that week.  Medium-bodied with a fruity-sweet flavor and aroma.",4.0,biff-pocoroba,4:

"October 27, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 1,  had one not tool long ago from a box code 00. they are again well and still got some strenght to them still. very complex but medium at best until the last inch where it amps up the strenght. if you take your time with these your heading for a great 2 hour journey!!! 9.5,4.5,loganx,33:

"August 22, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 1,  An excellent cigar and a unique size....  Perfect draw and fruity - spicy - woody tastes... Unfortunately discontinued cigar... Maybe the best cuban cigar ever!,5.0,haris-georgiou,31:

"January 16, 2017",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,  Yes to BonVivant another most splendid favourite of mine discontinued - anyone know why so many disappearing? IMO way too many giant ring size now introduced and not enough Dalias or corona extras around.,5.0,ian,51:
"January 11, 2017",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"  So sad - another La Gloria Cubana discontinued - amazing is not the word, ridiculous is more like it - stick with MAR-MAY 2013 codes and you will not regret it. Anything after that is your own risk. The cigar is simply brilliant - MUR MAY13",5.0,bonvivant,50:
"December 16, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"Very creamy cigar with some spices, cinamon and hints of orange fruit. Complex flavours with evolutions between thirds. Draw imperfect until the end of first third and afterwards great. Light to medium cigar of 90-100 minutes duration. A must !!!",4.5,heinrich,49:
"November 30, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"  2007 La Gloria Cubana Medaille d'Or No. 2. Just checking in to see how these are coming along. The verdict: Good, but not yet great. If I hadn't smoked a couple of boxes of 2002's, I would be impressed by the full bodied complexity. Pepper and spice with a fruity accompaniment. Unfortunately, the former elements overshadowed the latter. It showed too much of it's Partagas 898V heritage. These will take many years to mature into the delightful spicy and aromatic fruit salad that characterizes a vintage LGC. But the makings are all there, in spades.

"July 30, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"  I've been trying to get a box of these for ages as they used to be one of my favourites - finally did - had to spend a little more than I wanted to as my usual supplier doesn't ever seem to have them...arrived today and nearly finished my second. Excellent appearance, construction, draw; to start with not bad but wow these become amazing at the halfway point and continue to become sublime by the end. I am already dreaming about how these will be with a little rest after there journey in the post.",4.5,ian,47:
"April 14, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Gloriosos,"  Truly a magnificent cigar. Lovely floral, Woody, and honey flavots with a nice tart touch of lemon peel. Medium bodied and builds to a full bodied delight. Elegant packaging rounds out the experience. A real treat.
",5.0,professor-twain,4:
"December 9, 2014",La Gloria Cubana  Gloriosos,"  Hunters &amp; Frankau was not kidding around when it named this cigar the ""Gloriosos."" Everything about this release was tastefully done - aesthetics, marca specific profile, and balance. An exceptional cigar.",5.0,mk05,3:
"December 31, 2012",La Gloria Cubana  Gloriosos,"  Great representation of LGC brand/factory/flavor - fruit, little earth and citrus spice - this particular UK Regional Edition does brilliantly, compared to so many uninteresting REs around the World these days, especially La Gloria Cubana.",5.0,bonvivant,2:
"December 4, 2015",La Escepcion  Selectos Finos,"  One of the best Cuban's I have smoked in 20 years! Habanos is hit or miss for me but they had a master blending this cigar. Most of the time you have to be worried about getting a plugged cigar with a 38 ring gauge but not with the La Escepcion, perfect construction, great flavor, amazing cigar. These will be going for $1000s at auction in a few more years, I'm lucky I've got a box!",5.0,oregonsa,7:
"January 1, 2015",La Escepcion  Selectos Finos,"This is absolutely fantastic cigar, RG isnt big but stronger than imagine, smooth, flavorful and good taste in all thirds. It seems so hard to get now, but definitely worthwhile to get 1-2 sticks",4.5,hoepssa,6:
"September 21, 2013",La Escepcion  Selectos Finos,"  Terrific cigar. Hype and other reviewers claim these are very strong. For me it was smooth, very creamy, sweet with Sir Winston like flavors. No nicotine hit.  Lots of smoke and excellent aging potential. Love the format!",4.5,cigarcritic,5:
"December 31, 2012",La Escepcion  Selectos Finos,"  So the hype had settled and I received a blind from a friend and the wrapper was exploding, as it was smoked evry 1/3 of an inch

The funny thing is that it reminded me of Partagas from Sancti Spiritus factory form 2008-9 the same size, the same cigar, the same taste - just different packaging

My question is: Where is La Escepcion?",0.0,bonvivant,4:
"December 10, 2012",La Escepcion  Selectos Finos,"  To each his own LEM OCT 11

The idea is encouraging, the tobacco is good and the blend is inferior, plus the factory where it was rolled does not do the justice for a revival of a supposed to be great brand/cigar of the past. The packaging is superb and morbid at the same time - like an obituary  to something long gone and lost - very sad disappointment.",0.0,bonvivant,3:
"April 20, 2010",Davidoff  Tubos,"  My first foray into the world of cigars. I dont think I could selected a better cigar to initiate with. Mild yet robust. Flavorful yet not too overpowering. Made for a wonderfully calm, aromatic experience. I have stuck to these cigars ever since but am very keen to expand my horisons. I would recommend No. 2 Tubos to anyone, anytime!",4.5,naz,3:
"January 13, 2007",Davidoff  Tubos,Had one from 1985.  The smoke was very very smooth and had wonderful hints of citrus.  This is probably the only cigarI have had that has given that citrus flavor.  The wrapper was impeccable and the construction was flawless.  Truly one of a kind.,5.0,markf150,2:
"August 15, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Inmensos,"  The draw was loose at first, but once I got the hang of it and stopped with the overheating problems, it was a serious smoke. Balanced bouquet that is both pleasantly bitter and extremely aromatic. Skins of nuts, flowers, toast, cedar. Aromatic yet masculine. Quite tannic -- needs time. Comparable to Behike, IMO. 

What a difference it makes to the draw storing these smokes at 62%. I gave it four days at 69%, but I'm not sure it made it all the way back up. It is a massive cigar.",4.5,mjmmm,12:
"October 20, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Inmensos,"  The box date confuses me a bit. I thought that these were only made in 2010, and I haven't been able to find anything about later production runs. My guess is that this is part of the Habanos trend to age some cigars in factory and then stamp them again when they ship them out. 

Some of these do have draw issues, so I recommend using a punch, which pretty much eliminates that possibility. 

One of the most intriguingly aromatic cigars I've had the pleasure of smoking. Woodsy, flowery, sweet and spicy. Somewhat potpourri-like. It has a bouquet like a great wine. On the way home in my car, I habitually smelled the lingering aromas on my fingers. 

The burn and ash were perfect. As I stated above, the draw is lovely if you use a punch. 

Overall, an extremely aesthetically pleasing experience. It's not a 10 quite yet, but I believe that it will reach that level some time in the next few years.",4.5,mjmmm,11:
"September 20, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Inmensos,Very easy cigar perfect draw /smooth / burns evenly ! You really can sit back and enjoy and relax with this one,4.0,elias,10:
"July 22, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Inmensos,"  Perfect draw, construction and burn. Overall flavor profile contains figs, dates, molasses, dark chocolate, anise, and black truffle. A great cigar once aged 5 years min. A sweetness on the nose with hints of licorice.  The box I received has been full bodied. High recommended and yes, worth the price.",4.5,timothyarchambault,9:
"May 19, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Inmensos,"  It's a good cigar, but not exceptionally. I was expecting more. Md'Or 1,3,4 are better for me. 'll wait a few years and see how it changes. Box code MUR",3.5,kml,8:
"November 22, 2016",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  The H.upmann No. 2 is a very young cigar. With a box date of early 14 this cigar has great aging potential. With notes of toast, old coffee grounds, and wood this really is a stale cigar. No floral notes or sweetness but with years of age I can very easily see this cigar develop into a lovely and pleasant cigar. But right now, it is far too young and offeres very stale flavors.",3.5,hunterd16,106:
"October 8, 2016",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  These are great cigars depending on the years.  The 2012's are unbelievable, but the later ones sometimes have bad burns.  They are about 10-20 percent cheaper than Monte 2's and this is the reason.  They have typical strong, musty, nutty, and aromatic flavors and look great as they age.  Their aging potential is wonderful, but the uneven burns sometimes sour my overall view when taking the time to age.  It is better to wait on the Monte's IMHO, and smoke the Upmanns because they are really good when they are young.",4.5,owensinco,105:
"September 10, 2015",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  Medium flavored, starts with spice and white pepper. Subtle Upmann sweet woodiness is there but still possesses some predominate tannins from youth.Only slight evolution through the first two thirds, the final third was more complex with that Cuban earthiness and milk coffee coming through. Solid cigars, well constructed and burn well. I have sampled from all three boxes I have of the same factory/date code (UPE AGO13) and all have been amazingly consistent. Still, IMO these cigars will not come into their own without at least another three years age on them.",4.0,oli62,104:
"June 29, 2015",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  Bought duty free a long time ago and religiously stored. Great wrapper, feel, and pre light draw. Woody and honeyed first third and pretty much till the 1st half. From there hay, leather,  and  nuts with occasional cocoa until the end. Impeccable burn and nice white ash that refused to drop. No bitter or harsh flavors ever...a truly excellent cigar with fantastic taste.",4.5,bucketlist,103:
"May 30, 2015",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 2,"  I just bought and recieved 25 boxes of LUB Feb 14, yep that's 625 cigars in total, because I believe this is the best quality production of these and want to not only make sure there are plenty around for me in 2025-30 but also find this to be my second favorite vitola in the Upmann line. I'm a very experienced cigar smoker and despite the youth of 14 production,  these are far and away better quality cigars than any other year since probably 1994! I'm sorry for others who wasted their money on previous years because it truly was a waste of money compared to the LUB production in 2014. Glad I don't have to worry about getting this superior boxcode any further. Long ashes fellas!",5.0,tonyaccardo,102:
"February 12, 2016",H. Upmann  Coronas Minor," what a nice cigar! I have had the Junior and the Major. All of them are wonderful cigars. For me the Minor is by far the best of the three. Nice complex taste, but still mild and smooth. the bur is nice and even and the draw is also just right. One of the best cigars I have had in a very long time and the price is the best for this tipe of cigar. A must smoke!!",0.0,ktm,31:
"March 5, 2015",H. Upmann  Coronas Minor,"Lovely little cigar! Just had my first one while waiting at the airport to pick up a friend whose flight got delayed...

I'm definitely going to make this a regular in my humidor!",3.5,aliz,30:
"September 12, 2014",H. Upmann  Coronas Minor,"  With the exception of 4-5 from the box with a bit too tight draw, this is a great little cigar.Slow burning,sweet and enjoyable.IMO better than the half corona,but I like both :-)",4.5,pancig,29:

"November 1, 2009",H. Upmann  Coronas Minor,"  Yet another great little cuban. I have smoked 4 of these now, all rested for 4 months in the humidor after purchase. Not a great depth but if you want a trustworthy, tasty, satisfying 45min smoke this one works. All four burnt evenly if turned, never went out after being ignored for more than 5 mins and created voluminous amounts of smoke for a little ring gauge. I will definatly buy more!",4.0,tashaz,27:
"August 22, 2016",Hoyo de Monterrey  Le Hoyo du Depute,"This cigar is a mistery for me. While some produce interesting, refined and elegant smoking, others (too many of them) are completely tasteless. And the same is valid for other Hoyo de Monterey vitolas, like the Epicure n. 2. Not the kind of brand I intend to keep on buying, because of its extreme irregularity !!!",3.0,heinrich,25:
"February 22, 2012",Hoyo de Monterrey  Le Hoyo du Depute,Was bombed a hoyo depute last year November time. I decided to have a crack at it back in January as I was looking for a short smoke. I loved every minute of it! Texture was a light cream while flavours of fruit and nuts came and went with a breeze of a roast caramel. Very tasty! Will definitely have to pick up a cab very soon! Better than the hoyo epicure 2 in my humble opinion.,4.5,l_dog,24:
"July 11, 2011",Hoyo de Monterrey  Le Hoyo du Depute,"  piccolo ma tosto! ben costruito ed elegante nelle sue minime dimensioni, mandorle tostate e spezie, buono",4.5,goethe66,23:
"August 15, 2009",Hoyo de Monterrey  Le Hoyo du Depute,"  I was gifted a stick from the 1997 vintage of this viola and was absolutely amazed with the amount of flavor packed into this little surprise.  I hope that I can find a cab with some age as I'd hate to deprive myself of this little gem for a number of years. 

I'm one of those guys who typically doesn't have as much time to smoke as I'd like, so I go through lots of Monte 4's and PLPC's.  Rest assured, these will be added into that mix as soon as possible!",4.5,pokiestogie,22:
"August 11, 2009",Hoyo de Monterrey  Le Hoyo du Depute,"  This is a nice little cigar.  The draw wasn't superb but it wasn't bad either.  The flavours are definitely wood, leather, and subtle honey and cedar.  The du Depute seems more like traditional Hoyos than the du series, but it isn't bad at all.  I'd prefer the des dieux and the du roi more but they are much different formats than this little guy.  The burn was even and the smoke was medium.",3.5,cookj1,21:
"August 30, 2013",Vegueros  Seoane,"  A well-made, even-burning, good-drawing cigar with the floral notes common to this maker. A wonderful small cigar.",4.5,miskis,13:
"September 1, 2010",Vegueros  Seoane,"  After finishing a cardboard pack of 5 sticks over a period of a few months, I feel that I have come to understand this stick. Despite being touted as a fuller bodied marque, I found this particular stick quite mild in flavour and light in body. Quite a contrast to the No.1 and No. 2. On the tongue, mainly freshly brewed black coffee with aromatic wood and some dryish, cedary notes. But on the nose, very floral, sweet and fragrant, freshly cut grass and incense. Some citrusy nuances creep in towards the final third. One of those sticks that you must enjoy with your mouth and your nose. Ever present spice on the tongue. Surprisingly thick and voluminous smoke for such a small, delicate stick. Deceptively long. Very well made and burns even. More of an aperitif cigar and a good one at that. Now increasingly rare in Australia but will certainly age another pack of 5, maybe 2 packs, for the short term to see what happens.",4.0,sengjc,12:
"October 14, 2009",Vegueros  Seoane,"  Mild, but very good.  I was suprised by the amount of flavor.  Draw and smoke was great.  These are on the reorder list!!!",4.5,bludog,11:
"August 20, 2009",Vegueros  Seoane,"  After reading the reviews on this site; I thought it worth a try. I had expected a box of 25, not 5 packs of 5. They were smaller than I had expected, slightly oily and soft to touch with and a gentle aromatic tobacco smell. Not quiite my normal smoke- at least they appeared well made - hand made. On lighting, the taste was subtle with surprisingly plenty smoke for the size - a pleasant sweet smell. A most enjoyable easy any time of the day smoke - Had several - each one a simple unpretentious pleasure - any time of the day. Strangely it has grown on me - not normal for me to be affectionate towards a small cigar.",4.0,patrick5,10:
"August 22, 2015",Vegueros  Mareva,"  Not a great cigar. Not a bad cigar. Just a good cigar I smoke when taking a break fly fishing on the river. Full flavor for its size with notes of citrus, perhaps tangerine. Draws well.",3.5,miskis,12:
"March 11, 2015",Vegueros  Mareva,Most things are good with this cigar.A slight bitterness (mostly pepper) spoils the fun.Price is not bad but there are more classic offerings at similar prices.Surely one that deserves a try.,2.5,pancig,11:
"September 15, 2008",Vegueros  Mareva,Unique cigar. A must try once at least. Reviewer 5 is right about the draw and the uneven burn. Yet typical unusual grassy aromas. Simply unique,3.0,kriss,9:
"May 29, 2008",Vegueros  Mareva,"Very impressed with this Mareva.  It really is good quality.  Nice to look at, firm, burns well, nice aroma.  As described well by others, a unique sweet grassy flavour.  Mild cigar, great for a day smoke and a change of pace.  Also very reasonably priced.",3.5,swan25,8:
"February 7, 2013",La Corona  Petit Coronas,"  Amazing to get the same box/code with coronas/ panetelas and Petit coronas!

Amazing cigar from the early nineties a classicMM with a twist - strong, full body and obnoxious in a good way - one does not get/taste cigars like that these days, but if one never tried that one - it is a shame. Discontinued in 1999.

"July 29, 2013",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  A well-made medium-bodied cigar with a definite floral flavor along with a taste of citrus, maybe tangerine. Good draw and an even burn. A nice smoke.",4.5,miskis,18:
"April 20, 2013",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  Smoked the 4th out of a 99 box. Although these are rolled quite hard they had a perfect draw. Strenght is medium and there is not overly much evolution. There is some sweetness at the beginning which fades into coffee and chocolate. You can taste the fine, aged tobacco and there are some salty hints from time to time. I had 14 year old cigars smoking just like a shadow of their original taste - this one has developed into a rich and remarkable example of cuban craftmanship.",4.0,lost-trailer,17:
"April 14, 2013",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  Very nice small cigar. Full body, but it has lost some flavor since 2000. Nevertheless a very good one. Earthy, wood and cacao throughout. Even construction burn. Anyone who gets a hold of any Vegueros is lucky, as they have discontinued the brand from 2013. Shame, because this used to be a very nice line coming out directly from Pinar del Rio.",3.5,dimi681,16:
"March 30, 2010",Vegueros  Especiales No. 2,"  Got this as a free sample and probably dates back to 99 since the shop that was selling this has stocks of the 99 vintage and the fine powdery is evidence of its age. Then again, it might very well be dust and mold. In any case it wiped off easily enough without leaving a mark but I digress.
Anyway, it is quite an elegantly made short panatela with a smooth, colorado wrapper. Burns even with a workable draw. Overall flavours are mainly earth and wood with some dark chocolate and coffee. Not much sweetness and about a medium bodied smoke. Burnt nice and even. With some care, it did not overheat. Overall, the smoke was quite good actually.

The smell of decent oak wood and pure tobacco is very pleasant.

So, let's fire up that lil' baby. The first draws reveal a very intensive and strong taste. Wow... I hadn't expected it by a cigar of that age which is also said to be on the light side. Flavors of roasted nuts and coffee, wood, tobacco and leather are present from the very beginning. It starts with a beat of the drum! The combination is very well balanced and the flavors get more intensive and fade away in a very interesting interaction.

The second third is mainly characterized by woody and herbal components... sometimes a aroma of mushrooms joins.....

The last third shows what it really is: tobacco, pure tobacco. And that is the taste... old, pure tobacco... to be honest: that's what I would expect, 'cause in the end it is just a cigar.

The smoke was very thick, creamy... almost fat! The draw was perfect over the whole smoking time of 80 minutes, the burn-off was ruler-straight.

I'm happy that I opened the box. The cigar was a dream, is very tasty and good to smoke. I don't know how it will be in future if would rest still more years. I don't care about it and just enjoy the moment!",4.5,eldondo,2:

"May 29, 2009",Davidoff  Chateau Latour,"  I am halfway through the fragile stick of a 1988 Latour (a cigar which is as old as I am, interestingly enough).  This cigar, besides its obvious silky smoothness and muted earthy tones, is perhaps a little past its prime.  I don't know about other years or vintages with this cigar but perhaps its lost some of its personality through the decades.  On the other hand, the cigar is still satisfyingly rich and flavorful with notes of cedar and creamy, earthy tobacco.  Also, subtle strokes of exotic spice are occasionally detected, not unlike the no. 1 in this respect.  I also must concur with XXX on the leathery profile to this cigar as well, but once again a little muted and not quite as explosive as it must have been in its prime.

Pulled it from the \'dor last night for an end of FY party as I needed a gar that would last a good hour or so. On first impression the wrapper felt very toothy and had some large veins (warning sign). Unlit I smelt lots of fresh cut herbs and some wood. She lit easily and the first draw was cool and very easy, reminiscent of the larger R&amp;J vitolas. A little bland at first, she began to open up after about 15mins with some nice white pepper and leathery tones and a half hour in she really warmed up as well. Comments from colleagues on the smoke\'s aroma were positive. After 45 mins I finally understood what a lot of reviewers have said about construction flaws with Upmanns as I hit a plug, lost draw and had to relight. This happened consistently in the last half/third of the stick (4 relights all told) and whilst tolerable in a cheaper smoke, I don\'t expect it in \""better\"" Cubans. Overcame the plugs finally to suck her down to the nub while nursing some Turkey &amp; water. Can\'t really judge on the basis of one experience but I am having reservations about the Monarcas now and will carry a back-up when I do pull it. Apart from the sub-par (at this price range) wrapper and construction issues, this mild smoke suited the cocktail party well - would be a bit light for an after dinner toke though in my opinion.

"April 28, 2015",H. Upmann  Regalias,"  This is probably the best petit corona coming out of Cuba today, no question about it. I can't see paying $150-180 for a box of Upmann or Bolivar ""petit coronas"" when I can pay anywhere from $96-125 for a box of Regalias and get the same quality/texture of tobacco and alot of times get a better blended cigar with a Regalias! I think today, more than ever, the educated buyer/smoker knows that there is little to no difference between all of the petit coronas except for bands/presentation and price. Otherwise you're just as likely to get a great box of petit coronas buying a box of Regalias as you are buying a box of Siglo 2's. Maybe after the cigars have aged 7-8 years or more, the blends will blossom and seperate themselves, distinguish themselves from each other more, but if you plan on smoking the cigars within a year or two, you would be very, very hard pressed to be able to discern between one petit corona and another. The only differences you are going to experience between one brand versus another are the same differences you would see from one box to another of the same brand/vitola. So it boils down to what you're willing to spend and really it makes no sense whatsoever to buy the petit coronas that go for$150+ except for just saying you have those brands Iin your cabinet. The Regalias usually always have a bakers spice/herbal/leatherey/wheat toast and coffee-like aroma and flavor, especially when you retrohale throughout the smoke. The tobacco is usually always of a very good to great quality and has a velvety, leathery texture to it and this all holds true from box to box to box, making it, in my extensive experience with this particular cigar, a very consistently produced cigar in an industry/market of highly inconsistent cigars coming out of Cuba today. You cannot go wrong in purchasing a box of H. Upmann Regalias and if you're the type that subscribes and follows what other ""cigar gurus"" say, MRN claims this is one of the best cigars to age when it comes to the benefit recieved from the additional years accrued on the cigar, but he was also referring to the machine-made version, which I feel was quite a different cigar than to what the Regalias is today.

In my opinion this cigar is far superior to the Partagas Mille fleurs which is along with Romeo y Julieta Mille fleurs often mentioned as the top 3 cheap and cheerful cuban cigars. This Upmann features a boxpressed shape with lighter brown oily wrappper that exhibits an  excellent barnyard smell. Flavor base is medium bodied and consists of coffee, herbal, leather, creamy and sweet notes with just a little spice in the first third. I would consider the strenght of this cigar to be a medium. Construction is top notch except the burn seems to be a bit too fast on these cigars. Smoking time was about 1h and 15 minutes.

"March 10, 2006",H. Upmann  Petit Upmann,"This cigar is really a bit of a rough diamond. how anyone can say that this cigar is ""light"" or for beginners is suprising! I would certailny not recommend this stick to a beginner, unless of course you want to put them off cigars for life....may be a good thing though...do them a favour, save them some money and their marriage!! this stick is a scorching powerhouse right from the start...piercing flavour of burnt toast which is also very sour at the same time. The flavours come later on and are primarily dark chocolate moist earthy notes always with that sour afterburn on the middle to tip of the tongue. Its aroma is sort of fruity floral and herbaceous. Meanwhile the strength just gets greater right to the end until actually it does get a bit bucolic and tarry with the enevitable build up of oils in such a strong smoke. as you smoke the heaviness of the smoke crawls slowly down your throat and onto your chest (no I don't inhale). although this probably sounds like I'm giving this stick a bad review I'm not. This is a cigar for lovers of the strength of tobacco and is quite unlike anything else in the Upmann line-up. Its really more about the strenght than the flavour and as such will only appeal to certain palettes. They can sometimes suffer with a tight draw and some boxes are made up of very light insipid coloured wrappers which certainly don't appeal to me so check them first before you buy! This cigar can be enjoyed with a cup of strong sweet proper coffee at breakfast, on a brisk walk in the winter with the dogs, say after lunch, or equally well after a good curry...but never on an empty stomach! it would make an excellent nightcap. word of warning though..because it is so hard hitting on the palatte, any sticks you smoke on the same day subsequent to this one will not taste as you're used to. Finally the ""Corona Junior"" is the same sized cigar, but in a tube, so you pay a bit more for the aluminium! I once smoked one from a tube and it tasted even stronger than what I have described above, so don't know if its a slightly different blend with more ligero in it. what is for sure though is that these sticks could probably take some serious ageing!...""Hold on to your hats!""

Cigarette tobacco rolled into a cigar shape. What little taste it had was rather offensive. I managed to get through about one centimetre.

Coarse dark machine wrapper with many dark spots. Good draw &amp; combustion. Not bad, but not good either. Just bland. Nothing ""herbaceous"" as far as I can tell. Light body. The 9 years of age seem to have taken out all strength. Neutral tobacco taste. No development apart from increasing bitterness. Distant hints of Upmann aroma, but that may be due to autosuggestion.
