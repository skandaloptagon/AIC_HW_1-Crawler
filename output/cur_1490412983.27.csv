"September 20, 2011",La Gloria Cubana  Tapados,  a smooth and delightful cigar that slowed down my intake on other favourite cigars. How come its discontinued and its available in the market though?,3.5,dernaika,2:
"September 7, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,"  Great looking cigar from a box of ten circa 2000.  Been aging for a while so I expected great things. One of the most boring and one dimensional cigars I have smoked in a while.  Aroma and taste of hay, then well...hay, and more hay.  Never developed any flavors or strength, which I find odd.  I'll let my next sit for a day and hope for a better result.",3.5,bucketlist,31:
"December 29, 2014",La Gloria Cubana  Tainos,"  LRE DIC9 - A Julieta #2 is a big cigar, thus it must be perfect to keep a connoisseur's attention; and this example does not disappoint. This Partagas-rolled gem portrays the sweeter side of the LGC very well, yet is exceptionally balanced to deliver a lush profile (only 2013 Cohiba Esplendido gives this same feel that can only be described as ""cake."" A modern classic, and the last hurrah for LGC Tainos. Must not be missed.",4.5,mk05,30:

"June 23, 2007",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"Bought one of these at La Casa Del Habano aged for 5 years with a box date of May 2002. First off after I lit it the cigar the wrapper started to peel off. Terrible construction. I tried to not let it bother me so I continued to smoke it anyway. Flavors reminded me of fruits, almost like grapes. Personally I found it way too mild for my tastes. The aftertaste is hard to describe, but I didn't like it. I ended up giving it to a friend after only smoking it for about five mintues. He liked the flavors but found the aftertaste was gross. Bottom line is if you like an extremely mild cigar with fruit like flavors, you'll like it. I felt like it was just one big flavored cigarillo, but maybe that's just me.",0.5,cigar-are-good,7:
"August 28, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"I finally found a box of these gems, from 2000. Lighter body than the Med d line. A light floral bouquet of flavors with a hint of spice towards the end",4.5,habanohal,6:
"January 31, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"A cigar for serious aging, and one which was discontinued in 2001 I believe. Stock up while you can. A smooth taste, similar to the Tainos of ERM, and the same maker, but with a leathery silken finish reminiscent of many Churchills at age 5-10 years. Good to go with an aged brandy. Full of flowery, peppery, vanilla after tones. Construction good, although fans of round rolled bundles will be dissapointed.",4.0,peter-m-tokyo1,5:
"January 30, 2005",La Gloria Cubana  Sabrosos,"Very nice, very underrated smoke.  While on a trip to Cuba last March I smoked the best of everything the LCDH's had to offer.

"January 19, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 3,"  This beautiful, delicate cigar is like sipping honeysuckle from the vine, sweet, floral, and fruity. It has a touch of citrus peel. Must be stored and smoked with humidity low enough to allow a proper burn, and must be sipped gently. I'm finishing my third box of these and will miss them very much when they are gone. Very rare that I would score a cigar at 10 but this deserves it.",5.0,professor-twain,31:

Just like the last box I had about 20 years ago - a lot fuller and more complex than expected. Must remind myself to gently sip on these and they are splendid. Excellent draw and great aroma.

"November 30, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Medaille d'Or No. 2,"  2007 La Gloria Cubana Medaille d'Or No. 2. Just checking in to see how these are coming along. The verdict: Good, but not yet great. If I hadn't smoked a couple of boxes of 2002's, I would be impressed by the full bodied complexity. Pepper and spice with a fruity accompaniment. Unfortunately, the former elements overshadowed the latter. It showed too much of it's Partagas 898V heritage. These will take many years to mature into the delightful spicy and aromatic fruit salad that characterizes a vintage LGC. But the makings are all there, in spades.

Great looking, dark smooth wrapper with a wonderful wet barnyard aroma. Smoot and rich with a touch of spice opening. Fairly punchy with a rich tobacco taste which builds. Glad I bought a box! Great as a short(ish) smoke, top draw!",5.0,tomothebuilder,2:

"August 15, 2016",La Gloria Cubana  Inmensos,"  The draw was loose at first, but once I got the hang of it and stopped with the overheating problems, it was a serious smoke. Balanced bouquet that is both pleasantly bitter and extremely aromatic. Skins of nuts, flowers, toast, cedar. Aromatic yet masculine. Quite tannic -- needs time. Comparable to Behike, IMO. 

What a difference it makes to the draw storing these smokes at 62%. I gave it four days at 69%, but I'm not sure it made it all the way back up. It is a massive cigar.",4.5,mjmmm,12:
"October 20, 2015",La Gloria Cubana  Inmensos,"  The box date confuses me a bit. I thought that these were only made in 2010, and I haven't been able to find anything about later production runs. My guess is that this is part of the Habanos trend to age some cigars in factory and then stamp them again when they ship them out. 

Some of these do have draw issues, so I recommend using a punch, which pretty much eliminates that possibility. 

One of the most intriguingly aromatic cigars I've had the pleasure of smoking. Woodsy, flowery, sweet and spicy. Somewhat potpourri-like. It has a bouquet like a great wine. On the way home in my car, I habitually smelled the lingering aromas on my fingers. 

The burn and ash were perfect. As I stated above, the draw is lovely if you use a punch. 

Overall, an extremely aesthetically pleasing experience. It's not a 10 quite yet, but I believe that it will reach that level some time in the next few years.",4.5,mjmmm,11:

"August 20, 2016",Fonseca  KDT Cadetes,"This is a tricky cigar. Although latter ones were not as good (less flavour and often tight), I tried one after an entire day at the beach and it was among the best cigars of my life (salt, tobacco and cedar) !!!

"February 15, 2012",Fonseca  KDT Cadetes,"2010 boxes - when on song , is a mild smoke - woody, earthy, savoury, nutty. But often has tight draw problems. Also some samples are flat - just tobacco flavour. So consistency is an issue.",3.0,kalc,39:
"November 24, 2010",Fonseca  KDT Cadetes,"  MAR 2010 box, lovely tobacco with creamy cocoa, cedar and nuts flavour, much like Montecristo no.4 when on song or a milder Secretos. Unfortunately they are overly tightly rolled and half are virtually unsmokeable. When you consider the price, they might still be a bargain even if you have to chuck some away. 9 stars when rolled properly, 0-4 when plugged... how to rate it?",3.0,frenchkiwi,38:
"July 30, 2009",Diplomaticos  Diplomaticos No. 7,"  The wrapper of this more than 20 yo cigar is colorado-colored, very fine, a little bit shiny. The rolling seems to be perfect (and later on I can find a perfect draw).

The smell of decent oak wood and pure tobacco is very pleasant.

So, let's fire up that lil' baby. The first draws reveal a very intensive and strong taste. Wow... I hadn't expected it by a cigar of that age which is also said to be on the light side. Flavors of roasted nuts and coffee, wood, tobacco and leather are present from the very beginning. It starts with a beat of the drum! The combination is very well balanced and the flavors get more intensive and fade away in a very interesting interaction.

The second third is mainly characterized by woody and herbal components... sometimes a aroma of mushrooms joins.....

The last third shows what it really is: tobacco, pure tobacco. And that is the taste... old, pure tobacco... to be honest: that's what I would expect, 'cause in the end it is just a cigar.

The smoke was very thick, creamy... almost fat! The draw was perfect over the whole smoking time of 80 minutes, the burn-off was ruler-straight.

I'm happy that I opened the box. The cigar was a dream, is very tasty and good to smoke. I don't know how it will be in future if would rest still more years. I don't care about it and just enjoy the moment!",4.5,eldondo,2:
"September 7, 2009",Davidoff  Mille series 5000,"  Smoked one of these from 1985 the other night.  What a wonderful smoke.  Very light at the outset, a sweet and creamy, honey-like taste was delivered.  This maintained throughout in varying strengths, blending with other tastes as they developed.  Sometimes playing the lead role, while at other times taking a back seat, but it never did go away.  By an inch in I was detecting hints of spice such as ciniemon and mustard.  These gave was to notes of oakish hardwoods by 2 inches and rich dried fruit by 3-4 inches.  In the final inch the taste changed again, delivering a nice toasty finish.  A wonderful ending to a simply wonderful cigar.  This was certainly a cigar to remember, but alas, I have but 2 left!  :o(",5.0,knuck42,3:

"July 7, 2014",Hoyo de Monterrey  Le Hoyo du Maire,  A nice coffee cigar. The lack of ligero leaf makes it not be a proper cigar. But who cares if you light it up after lunch or breakfast.

Yet it was definately not without its merit.  Complex flavor profile that continualy changed.  Denoted honey, cream, hazelnut, light hints of espresso in the finish, even hardwood was present.  As noted, there was somethng of a draw issue.  Despite this it was a very enjoyable cigar due to the complexities offered in taste.

This mellows out to deeper notes, including a touch of cedar and leather towards the end which a butter finish with a dash of pepper. The smoothest smoke out there...it took me totally by surprise and may well have established itself as my new favourite.

Unlit it had slightly more tooth than some better Cubans I have experienced (the wrapper had some prominent veins) and smelt strongly of the cedar in the 'dor. Nice, easy draw once lit and lots of soft, cool smoke. In fact, it almost felt as if it was slightly underpacked, reminiscent of R &amp; J, which I do not mind as I abhor a tight draw. Could not detect any of the grassiness usually attributable to this brand, in fact, it had a medium strength and a mellow mix of white pepper and some spice in the mouth.
Coupled with 3 fingers of Glenlivet and good friends it was a relaxing hour; not a stick to sit &amp; study with your tasting notes and pen in hand (I think we sometimes miss the point with cigars, good ones should never intrude into your contemplation or conversation).",3.5,uncle,2:

Apart from perfect construction, we were all struck by the elegance and subtlety of the cigar. 
One should not have expectations, and obviously this cigar is already ""aethereal"", almost expired.
The burning wrapper exhibited a very distinct roasted onion/ caramelized garlic smell I have found hallmark of vintage cigars.
Yet it was a very unique experience, the texture being still there, clean and fresh, and that really aethereal mineral (slate)/ faint wine-like bouquet and remains of nuttiness...
Truly subtle and decent, special and hard to appreciate nowadays.

"May 29, 2009",Davidoff  Chateau Latour,"  I am halfway through the fragile stick of a 1988 Latour (a cigar which is as old as I am, interestingly enough).  This cigar, besides its obvious silky smoothness and muted earthy tones, is perhaps a little past its prime.  I don't know about other years or vintages with this cigar but perhaps its lost some of its personality through the decades.  On the other hand, the cigar is still satisfyingly rich and flavorful with notes of cedar and creamy, earthy tobacco.  Also, subtle strokes of exotic spice are occasionally detected, not unlike the no. 1 in this respect.  I also must concur with XXX on the leathery profile to this cigar as well, but once again a little muted and not quite as explosive as it must have been in its prime.  Overall, a surprisingly rich cigar for its age and full of some very opulent, seductive flavor profiles.  A+",4.0,griff86,3:

Although the draw, construction and burn were beyond reproach, I found the DP lacked the complex and seductive flavours displayed by the 1990s Montecristo A from my collection we smoked the same evening.

Very quick smoke, which can be an advantage if you have children! I found the draw had to be gentle due to the size as it could get a bit ashy in taste. When it did I gently blew down the cigar and expelled the hot smoke. The next draw was sweet and tangy.

What an impressive, marvellous cigar! Picture-book construction and appearance.
Compared within its size, this cigar was not too light-bodied at 20 years of age - a 2002 Hoyo Particulare was considerably lighter styled.
The smoke was still quite chewy and full, but a bit drying/ dusty in the beginning as well. Flavours were predominantly chalky, a slight edge of dry oak, wool and roasted nuts, as a friend stated.
It evolved to a more roasted, clay and milk coffee taste in the second third.
Very impressive, but also strangely reminding of Honduras taste profiles - that bittersweet creamyness, that velvet structure... Highly interesting, and clean tasting throughout.
I would rate strength as 1,5-2/5.

"September 1, 2010",Vegueros  Seoane,"  After finishing a cardboard pack of 5 sticks over a period of a few months, I feel that I have come to understand this stick. Despite being touted as a fuller bodied marque, I found this particular stick quite mild in flavour and light in body. Quite a contrast to the No.1 and No. 2. On the tongue, mainly freshly brewed black coffee with aromatic wood and some dryish, cedary notes. But on the nose, very floral, sweet and fragrant, freshly cut grass and incense. Some citrusy nuances creep in towards the final third. One of those sticks that you must enjoy with your mouth and your nose. Ever present spice on the tongue. Surprisingly thick and voluminous smoke for such a small, delicate stick. Deceptively long. Very well made and burns even. More of an aperitif cigar and a good one at that.

Anyway, it is quite an elegantly made short panatela with a smooth, colorado wrapper. Burns even with a workable draw. Overall flavours are mainly earth and wood with some dark chocolate and coffee. Not much sweetness and about a medium bodied smoke. Burnt nice and even. With some care, it did not overheat. Overall, the smoke was quite good actually.

The flavour was excellent for the first third, smooth and aromatic with a medium flavour - indicative of spice and leather. the second third developed the flavour - bringing in a classic pepper and slightly bitter (I say this in a good way) flavour. However, I left the cigar and then returned to it for the final third and the flavour had become over-developed and not as good as the mid point.

Anyway, stuck it in the humidor for 3 months. Finally caved in to temptation and got one out today after dinner.

Prelit aroma of earthy hay and milk chocolate. Well made and the wrapper looks darker than usual HDMs. Clipped it to make a small hole as HDMs tend to be light in body and I was hoping for a greater concentration of the smoke.

First third was light with sweet woody tones and a tinge of leather. As it progresses to the second third, there is more leather and toasty flavours creep in, yet the sweet woodiness remains. With the final third, the body steps up a notch. Around the last quarter, the smoke becomes slightly tannic.

Even with the smaller than usual hole, the draw was excellent. The burn is even. Plenty of smoke but it is rather light in body. Excellent flavours and perfumy aroma prevail throughout. Elegant and not overpowering. A cigar for the day rather than for the night in my opinion. One for the golf course or party rather than solitary contemplation.",4.5,sengjc,34:

"June 2, 2015",Hoyo de Monterrey  Petit Robusto,"Two years ago I said I'd be happy if this was the only cigar in the world.Today I come back to these just to express my disappointment because of their almost consistently unacceptable construction for some time now.Draw is so tight that they are almost unsmokable.I store my cigars very well and I know that these are problems of really bad quality control.At some point the myth that these things happen in hand made cigars,has to stop.These things happen only in CC's .
When at last our hard earned money will be respected?No more money from me to HDM no matter how ""good"" they are when you are able to smoke one.The rating is just for construction issues,sorry but enough with these.",0.5,pancig,185:
"May 15, 2015",Hoyo de Monterrey  Petit Robusto,"Very good cigar, it smokes very well with some
flavour development. It's tasty and elegant, light and consistent. I'm not a Hoyo fan but i loved this petit robusto. A must have in my humidor. Higly recomended.",5.0,joaozinho30,184:
"December 3, 2016",Hoyo de Monterrey  Palmas Extra,"  For the price point and compared to others in it's size class, these cigars are really terrific. I think they get a few points knocked off because they are mixed filler but does that really matter at $3 a cigar? Flavor profile is classic Cuban Hoyo with a blend of earth, wood and herbs. Medium bodied and great with a cup of coffee. I personally wouldn't smoke after a meal but to each their own. Pick up a box, you won't be disappointed.",4.0,jgarofalo3,29:

"August 1, 2015",Hoyo de Monterrey  Palmas Extra, Why this little gem doesn't get higher reviews I'll never know they are FANTASTIC! So please keep the reviews bad so I can keep buying them cheaper! One of the fly under the radar cigars for sure,0.0,hunter1974,27:
"May 4, 2013",Hoyo de Monterrey  Palmas Extra,  What a nice cigar! I buy only 3 in la casa del habano and I have a beautiful experience. This cigar is hand made(long filer) now!!! and they are now packed in cedar boxes of 25 without cellophane. The cigar are very good looking especially if they are dark. Very neat raper without veins better then on the much more expensive cigars... The taste are very clear Cuban woody which is good in my opinion. Only i have to blame that i have to re-light cigar but i am a slow smoker... In my opinion score is 10 first because of quality and second because of price.,5.0,markicman,26:

"July 12, 2004",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares LE 2001,"I smoked one on my wedding day May last year after having waited for them to arrive for two years. It was worth the wait. Smooth, not overpowering, no burning feeling at all. A perfect way to end a perfect day!!
I have 4 left for other special occasions.

"November 18, 2003",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares LE 2001,Beautiful oily reasonably dark finish on the wrapper and overall excellent presentation. The draw was smooth and the flavours sweet and vibrant. The smoke was concentrated and creamy. A truly great cigar.,5.0,dave-chadwick,2:

"November 20, 2013",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares,"  Rich, mellow tobacco flavors with subtle complexity that progresses through vanilla, a touch of anise, cinnamon, pear with variations all along the way...but overall it is the wonderful tobacco taste and aromas that make this a magnificent cigar.",5.0,miskis,11:
"March 12, 2011",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares,"  Box of 5 arrived today Oct/02. Great construction and nice even burn. Slightly oily wrapper- a flintstone size length. The
aroma on this cigar is ambrosia-floral and exotic wood flavors- medium mild strength. A tightly rolled cigar which likely accounts for the tight draw with little smoke produced which almost spoils the integrity of the whole cigar. If this drew well, it would be a 10+. I will wait to rate this cigar until I have tried several others.",0.0,neuticles,9:
"February 22, 2011",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares,"  i bought a box of five of these coffined ladies at Marina Hemmingway in Havana in 2004 (stamped 2002) and am smoking my second to last tonight, February 21, 2011. During the interim I have kept the in my humidor, smoking one every couple of years to test how they age - and do they ever age well! 7 years after leaving Cuba and their character remains - smooth, still oily wrapper, medium flavour, smooth draw with definite hints of leather, subtle vanilla, slightly sweet, strong coffee flavour! A great find...i'll let you know how the last one tastes in a few years!",5.0,cohibacanuck,8:
