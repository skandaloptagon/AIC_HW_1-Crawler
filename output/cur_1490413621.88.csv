"September 20, 2011",La Gloria Cubana  Tapados,  a smooth and delightful cigar that slowed down my intake on other favourite cigars. How come its discontinued and its available in the market though?,3.5,dernaika,2:
"October 11, 2012",La Flor de Cano  Short Robusto,"  Bought a box on the back of a lot of hype, and well worth it!
Great looking, dark smooth wrapper with a wonderful wet barnyard aroma. Smoot and rich with a touch of spice opening. Fairly punchy with a rich tobacco taste which builds. Glad I bought a box! Great as a short(ish) smoke, top draw!",5.0,tomothebuilder,2:
"April 20, 2010",Davidoff  Tubos,"  My first foray into the world of cigars. I dont think I could selected a better cigar to initiate with. Mild yet robust. Flavorful yet not too overpowering. Made for a wonderfully calm, aromatic experience. I have stuck to these cigars ever since but am very keen to expand my horisons. I would recommend No. 2 Tubos to anyone, anytime!",4.5,naz,3:
"January 13, 2007",Davidoff  Tubos,Had one from 1985.  The smoke was very very smooth and had wonderful hints of citrus.  This is probably the only cigarI have had that has given that citrus flavor.  The wrapper was impeccable and the construction was flawless.  Truly one of a kind.,5.0,markf150,2:
"September 7, 2009",Davidoff  Mille series 5000,"  Smoked one of these from 1985 the other night.  What a wonderful smoke.  Very light at the outset, a sweet and creamy, honey-like taste was delivered.  This maintained throughout in varying strengths, blending with other tastes as they developed.  Sometimes playing the lead role, while at other times taking a back seat, but it never did go away.  By an inch in I was detecting hints of spice such as ciniemon and mustard.  These gave was to notes of oakish hardwoods by 2 inches and rich dried fruit by 3-4 inches.  In the final inch the taste changed again, delivering a nice toasty finish.  A wonderful ending to a simply wonderful cigar.  This was certainly a cigar to remember, but alas, I have but 2 left!  :o(",5.0,knuck42,3:
"February 1, 2007",Davidoff  Mille series 5000,"Probably one of my favorite smokes in the Davidoff line.  While not as rich as the LaTour's or the Haut Briones these little babies perform with an amazing quality for such a small smoke.

Excellent flavors throughout that are uniquely Davidoff.",4.0,xxx,2:
"July 30, 2009",Diplomaticos  Diplomaticos No. 7,"  The wrapper of this more than 20 yo cigar is colorado-colored, very fine, a little bit shiny. The rolling seems to be perfect (and later on I can find a perfect draw).

The smell of decent oak wood and pure tobacco is very pleasant.

So, let's fire up that lil' baby. The first draws reveal a very intensive and strong taste. Wow... I hadn't expected it by a cigar of that age which is also said to be on the light side. Flavors of roasted nuts and coffee, wood, tobacco and leather are present from the very beginning. It starts with a beat of the drum! The combination is very well balanced and the flavors get more intensive and fade away in a very interesting interaction.

The second third is mainly characterized by woody and herbal components... sometimes a aroma of mushrooms joins.....

The last third shows what it really is: tobacco, pure tobacco. And that is the taste... old, pure tobacco... to be honest: that's what I would expect, 'cause in the end it is just a cigar.

The smoke was very thick, creamy... almost fat! The draw was perfect over the whole smoking time of 80 minutes, the burn-off was ruler-straight.

I'm happy that I opened the box. The cigar was a dream, is very tasty and good to smoke. I don't know how it will be in future if would rest still more years. I don't care about it and just enjoy the moment!",4.5,eldondo,2:
"March 4, 2013",El Rey del Mundo  Elegantes,"  What a gem. Okay the draw was not 100%, a bit tight but for such a thin hand rolled cigar still okay. First of all the cold drawn was full of honey. Lighting it up - no honey flavor very subtile. Burn was perfect. Loads of dark chocolate, coffee and mint like you can find this in Bendicks Bittermint. And for a surprise a really strong one. If get a hand on it buy them.",5.0,perla,5:
"October 24, 2011",El Rey del Mundo  Elegantes,"  The stronger of the two panatelas largas from El Rey Del Mundo, this cigar delivers a strength to the typical minerality and sweetness that are the hallmark of a classic brand.  Unfortunately, they are no more.",4.5,ewipper,4:
"January 11, 2010",El Rey del Mundo  Elegantes,"  From box PRO LROO (Partagas factory).Averange construction, dark wrapper with spot of oil.No problem with burn, goes slowly.Draw no loose no tight.Started light, after inch goes more stronge.Stronger in finish.Good aroma like Demi Taste, woody, coffee taste.Nice.I am glad to try its slim panatela.",4.0,kml,3:
"August 1, 2009",El Rey del Mundo  Elegantes,  Smoked my first of a box last night.  The first inch is very subtle after this the cigar builds in flavor.  By the second inch it has classic erdm flavors.  Sipped slow this takes a while to smoke but is very rewarding,4.0,ahbroody,2:
"February 7, 2013",La Corona  Petit Coronas,"  Amazing to get the same box/code with coronas/ panetelas and Petit coronas!

Amazing cigar from the early nineties a classicMM with a twist - strong, full body and obnoxious in a good way - one does not get/taste cigars like that these days, but if one never tried that one - it is a shame. Discontinued in 1999.

"November 24, 2004",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares LE 2001,"Despite some draw problems so common in A-sized cigars, this cigar commands full score since the quality of the tobacco is nothing short of magical.  We are beyond analyzing taste and aroma here.  This cigar is just full of life.",5.0,tang,4:
"July 12, 2004",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares LE 2001,"I smoked one on my wedding day May last year after having waited for them to arrive for two years. It was worth the wait. Smooth, not overpowering, no burning feeling at all. A perfect way to end a perfect day!!
I have 4 left for other special occasions.

"November 18, 2003",Hoyo de Monterrey  Particulares LE 2001,Beautiful oily reasonably dark finish on the wrapper and overall excellent presentation. The draw was smooth and the flavours sweet and vibrant. The smoke was concentrated and creamy. A truly great cigar.,5.0,dave-chadwick,2:

"January 17, 2013",La Corona  Perfectos,"Purchased at Habanos in Tehran (Iran). Production date before 2000 (old box coding). Sold at the original low price. Not as dense as younger cigars due to its age. Easily lit, even burn and cold draw.   Mild to medium with lesser tobacco taste, sweet, nutty and a bit earthy. Overall a good Habano experience.",4.0,hrgerami-hotmail-com,3:

"July 20, 2012",Juan Lopez  Obus,"To me this was one of the better releases.  Sadly, I only have one left.  I will keep it and treasure it and remember all its brothers that fell before it. Full bodied, rich, and incredibly fragrant smoke. I had very minimal burn issues but the draw was excellent.  The French got very lucky with this release.  Buy it if you can find it.  With age it could be a classic.",4.5,cookj1,2:

"April 11, 2013",H. Upmann  Upmann No. 1,I picked up the last 8 of these remaining in a box at the Hotel Sevilla two years ago. The first one was good but it was very tightly rolled and as a result it was difficult to get lots of smoke.  Over a year later I grabbed another one and it was perfect.  Impeccable draw. Great draw. And all those great H.Upmann flavours you want.  What a fantastic cigar if you get a good one. Unfortunately these seem to have gone the way of the dodo bird.,4.0,cookj1,4:

"November 30, 2014",H. Upmann  Robustos,"If there could be a classic robusto, this would be in the running. Medium strength, tasty, perfect construction and not boring. Did not lose it at the end at all. Lotta smoke with the perfect draw. The one I smoked was relatively young, yet it tasted really good from start to finish.",4.5,the-boxcar,2:
"July 2, 2005",H. Upmann  Royal Coronas,"My first Upmann, I bought this loose along with a Monarcas about 2 months ago from Alexander\'s in Melbourne. Pulled it from the \'dor last night for an end of FY party as I needed a gar that would last a good hour or so. On first impression the wrapper felt very toothy and had some large veins (warning sign). Unlit I smelt lots of fresh cut herbs and some wood. She lit easily and the first draw was cool and very easy, reminiscent of the larger R&amp;J vitolas. A little bland at first, she began to open up after about 15mins with some nice white pepper and leathery tones and a half hour in she really warmed up as well. Comments from colleagues on the smoke\'s aroma were positive. After 45 mins I finally understood what a lot of reviewers have said about construction flaws with Upmanns as I hit a plug, lost draw and had to relight. This happened consistently in the last half/third of the stick (4 relights all told) and whilst tolerable in a cheaper smoke, I don\'t expect it in \""better\"" Cubans. Overcame the plugs finally to suck her down to the nub while nursing some Turkey &amp; water. Can\'t really judge on the basis of one experience but I am having reservations about the Monarcas now and will carry a back-up when I do pull it. Apart from the sub-par (at this price range) wrapper and construction issues, this mild smoke suited the cocktail party well - would be a bit light for an after dinner toke though in my opinion.
